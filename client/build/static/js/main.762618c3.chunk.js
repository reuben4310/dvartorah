The Torah teaches us that God created the world through ten utterances: through Divine speech. With each holy command, our universe was formed. Hashem implanted this gift of speech within man. Of all earth\u2019s creatures, only humans are endowed with the ability to verbally communicate intelligently. We must be ever mindful that, even as God created through \u201cwords,\u201d on our own level, we too create through words./\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime and again, the Torah cautions us to be very careful with that which escapes our lips, for, as King Solomon tells us, \u201cDeath and life are in the tongue.\u201d Before speaking, stop for a moment and consider how your words impact others. What sort of environment and relationships do you create with your speech? Do you speak to your family and friends with love and respect? Do you think about what you\u2019re saying before you say it and the effect that it will have on those with whom you communicate? How careful are you with that which escapes from your lips?/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more commandments in the Torah in regard to speech than to any other mitzvah: seventeen negative and fourteen positive mitzvos. It is through speech that we signaled our commitment to our Covenant at Sinai when we proclaimed, \u201cNa\u2019aseh V\u2019nishma \u2014 We shall do it and we shall study it.\u201d It is through speech \u2014 prayer \u2014 that we speak to God on a daily basis, bringing a positive spiritual influence into the mundane. Yet speech can have terribly negative effects as well: It was through speech that Hitler committed the most unspeakable evil ever to be perpetrated upon mankind. He himself never lifted a weapon; he used his lethal tongue to incite the world to hatred and slaughter. Indeed, \u201cDeath and life are in the tongue.\u201d/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThink before you speak and ask yourself, \u201cWill my words generate light or darkness, love or hatred, blessing or curse?\u201d The choice is yours to make.

He gave Noah the building plans for the ark: make an ark of gopher wood and make many rooms. The ark should be covered inside and out with pitch. It should be 300 cubits in length, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. He then proceeds to the details, telling him how many floors there should be and where the window and door should be placed.

(Gen. 12:1)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah portion begins with Avraham's first trial: to give up his entire past and follow God's lead to a new land: God said to Avram, \"Go for yourself from your land, from your relatives, and from your father's house to the land that I will show you.\" When a person leaves his hometown, he first leaves his father's house, then his neighborhood (his relatives), and then his country. Why does the verse list these in the opposite order?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person makes a physical departure, he first leaves his father's house, then his relatives, and then his country. However, the verse is alluding to Avraham's departure in a spiritual sense. \"Leaving your hometown\" means changing your old ways and leaving behind your bad habits. Therefore, the order in the verse is reversed, starting with the easier things. The culture of a person's country is not so deeply ingrained, and so it can be uprooted relatively easily. More difficult is to get rid of bad habits a person acquired amongst his social circle and friends. Finally, to shake off bad traits acquired at home is very challenging./\r\n\r\nThe Sfas Emes quotes the Zohar, which states that God called out \"Go for yourself,\" in every generation, but Avraham was the only one to respond to God's call. God still calls out \"go for yourself\" today, and we need to respond. We must distance ourselves from bad habits and serve God even though it may require inconvenience or hardship."},{ID:5,parshaId:3,vort:"Avraham came forward and said, \u201cWill You also stamp out the righteous along with the wicked?\u201d. (18:23)/\r\n\r\nGod revealed to Avraham his plan to destroy Sodom. As soon as Avraham heard the news he began praying for its survival. What is difficult to understand is that Sodom\u2019s lifestyle was diametrically opposed to Avraham\u2019s way of life and teachings. Avraham was the epitome of chesed (loving kindness). His whole life revolved around helping others. However, in Sodom chesed was considered a crime! One could get executed for just giving charity to a pauper. Why then did Avraham pray on behalf of the corrupt inhabitants of Sodom?/\r\n\r\nOften people preach kindness, but they get angry and hate those who dispute their values. This is because their kindness is coming from the love that they have for themselves. They are trying to build up their own confidence and self-esteem. Avraham\u2019s kindness was based on his love for other people. It is true that the people of Sodom were doing wicked acts, but Avraham loved them and therefore anger and animosity did not play a role in whether or not to pray for them./\r\n\r\nWhen doing acts of kindness out of love the kindness will continue even when it\u2019s hard and difficult for you, such as when a person takes care of his children even when it\u2019s difficult. His love for his child overrides any personal feelings he may have. Furthermore, this type of selfless kindness can really help someone grow and become a greater person. Similarly, the Talmud relates that there were thugs frequenting R\u2019 Meir\u2019s neighborhood. They caused R\u2019 Meir so much aggravation that he prayed they should die. R\u2019 Meir\u2019s wife, Bruria, said to him, \u201cInstead of praying for their deaths pray that they should repent!\u201d R\u2019 Meir prayed on their behalf and they returned to God."},{ID:6,parshaId:3,vort:"vayera vort"},{ID:7,parshaId:4,vort:'[Avraham says to Eliezer] And I will have you swear by Hashem, God of heaven and God of earth, that you not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell." (Gen. 24:3)/\r\n\r\nAfter the Akeida, Avraham resolved to seek a wife for Yitzchak. He sent Eliezer on the mission but told him that he did not want to take a wife for Yitzchak from the Canaanites, nor from the seven nations. Avraham did not trust Eliezer and therefore had him swear. The difficulty with this is that the previous verse mentions that Eliezer was in charge of all of Avraham\'s assets. Avraham had complete trust in him. Why then does Avraham not trust him when it comes to finding his son a wife?/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to spiritual matters, people generally trust one another. If one sees a man with a beard eating in a restaurant, he\'ll eat there without further inquiry. If someone tells him, "I think it\'s okay to do such and such," he\'ll do it in a second without asking further. However, when it comes to the mundane, people will research and seek many opinions before finalizing their purchase. Just because a car dealer says "Trust me..." it won\'t satisfy them./\r\n\r\nWe see from Avraham the exact opposite. When it came to his money, he put Eliezer fully in charge and trusted all his decisions. However, in spiritual matters, where Yitzchak\'s mate had to be the next Sarah - a woman who would not only be a wife but also a matriarch - for that he did not trust Eliezer.(1)/\r\n\r\nRabbi Yisrael Salanter was once traveling to a distant city. On the way, he passed a small town and decided to rest in one of the inns. The innkeeper, sensing that his guest was a devout Jew, approached Rabbi Salanter and asked: "Excuse me, but would you happen to be a shochet (a ritual slaughterer)? I have a cow in the barn that needs to be slaughtered. I usually go to our neighboring town to have it slaughtered. If you are a shochet then you can save me a big trip."/\r\n\r\nRabbi Salanter responded, "I am not a shochet."/\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, Rabbi Salanter approached the innkeeper and asked, "Perhaps you would be kind enough to lend me some money?"/\r\n\r\n"Give you a loan?" replied the innkeeper in surprise., "Bbut I don\'t even know you! How can I trust you to pay me back?"/\r\n\r\n"Listen to what you just said," said Rabbi Salanter. "When it came to loaning me money - even a small amount - you would not trust me as I am a stranger to you. Yet when you wanted to slaughter your cow, you were prepared to rely on me though you have absolutely no idea who I am! Shechita (kosher slaughter) involves many intricate Jewish laws.

Yaakov replied, "I\'ll sell it to you for the birthright." Eisav said, "Look I am going to die, so of what use to me is the birthright?" After he sold the birthright to Yaakov, the verse tells us that Eisav looked at the birthright with disdain./\r\n\r\nRashi explains that Eisav feared the birthright since he knew that the birthright entailed responsibilities such as performing the service in the Holy Temple, and if there were any shortcomings in his performance he could be punished with death. If so, why was he considered to have treated the birthright with disdain by selling it? On the contrary, he was showing the importance of the birthright and the dignity in which the service must be conducted!?/\r\n\r\nIn the course of life, God "throws" us many opportunities which can make us greater. He gives us an opening to start a great project or a position where we can influence and elevate others. The Torah is telling us not to let these opportunities slip away. Don\'t say, "It\'s too hard for me," or "I\'ll do it tomorrow..." Eisav had the opportunity to do the service of the birthright and gave it up. The Torah considers the passing up of such an opportunity a disgrace!

We see from Yaakov that giving a tithe to charity is not limited to money - it actually includes anything that God gives you. Yaakov says to God, "Whatever you shall give me, I shall repeatedly tithe it to you." You are required to share with others any talents or knowledge that God has granted you. Just like God gave you money to be able to help others, He gives positive attributes and qualities so that you can help others./\r\n\r\nIndeed, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated that a Jew should tithe his time, contributing a portion of his time to the service of worthy causes. A poor woman once visited the home of Rabbi Feinstein, and requested a meeting with him. "Why do you need to speak with the Rabbi?" asked one of the members of Rabbi Feinstein\'s family./\r\n\r\n"I received a letter from my sister who lives in Russia," the woman said.

A frightened Yaakov prays to God, "Rescue me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eisav." Why did Yaakov repeat himself in describing Eisav? He should have said, "Rescue me from Eisav," or "Rescue me from my brother." What was the purpose of using both terms?/\r\n\r\nYaakov\'s fear was two-pronged. He was afraid that "Eisav" would act with enmity and threaten his physical survival. He also feared the spiritual danger of greeting Eisav as his brother. He feared that Eisav would have a negative influence on his family if they ended up making peace. He therefore prayed to God to save him from both outcomes./\r\n\r\nRemarkably, Yaakov prayed for his spiritual well-being before he prayed to be saved from physical danger! He was more concerned over the negative influence that Eisav may have on him than he was concerned for his life!/\r\n\r\nBy nature, people adapt their behavior to their surroundings; they begin to think and act like their neighbors.

We learn from this the great reward that the righteous enjoy./\r\n\r\nImagine a man who was arrested and is about to be transported to a prison which houses dangerous criminals. The officer sees him shaking like a leaf and tells him \"Don't worry - there is some good news - the bus that's transporting you to prison has a good smell!\" The man stares at the officer in amazement. The last thing he cares about is how his transportation to prison smells!/\r\n\r\nJoseph was being sold as a slave. The last thing he cared about was the aroma; all he wanted was to be freed.

He realizes that he has been kidnapped! He starts crying for his parents, only to be ignored - causing him to cry even harder. The man stops the car and says, \"We are going to eat now.\" The little boy opens up the platter and is shocked to see that the food is the same thing that he eats every day, in the exact same way that his mother prepares it for him. He realizes that it must be that his mother sent this food and she must have arranged this whole ride. He hasn't been kidnapped; he's in safe hands! He stops crying and immediately feels at ease. He feels great!/\r\n\r\nJoseph's brothers wanted to execute him. He was thrown into a pit feeling abandoned and lost. He was sold to a caravan of Ishmaelites who always had foul-smelling wagons. However, this time there was a pleasant smell. He understood the message: God was telling him that all of these events were part of the plan: \"Don't worry, I'm holding your hand the whole way through.\"/\r\n\r\nSometimes we may go through very hard periods, but throughout them, we see seemingly random events that appear unusual - almost like a miracle.

He was sold four times and ended up as a slave in Egypt, a country filled with immorality. Nevertheless, Yosef's spirit remained strong. His master's wife tempted him every single day for a year, but he fought off his evil inclination. One day she grabbed him. He pulled himself away and ran out of the house. His master's wife placed the blame on him and Yosef landed in jail. Is that Yosef's reward for fighting his desires? Imprisonment?! He spent many years in prison, not knowing if he would ever be a free man again. Yet, Yosef's faith in God did not waver./\r\n\r\nAfter 12 years in prison, he was summoned to Pharaoh. He was given a golden opportunity to attain freedom. If only he would appease Pharaoh he could start life anew. Yosef knew that Pharaoh did not believe in God - he believed that he himself was God. Pharaoh said to him, \"I heard that you know how to interpret dreams.\" Yosef replied, \"I'm sorry, you have the wrong person, God is the one that interprets dreams\". By saying this he could have lost this opportunity and been thrown back into the dungeon! He could have justified himself in thinking that now was not the right time to attribute everything to God. And yet he did not hesitate to attribute all of his talents to God!/\r\n\r\nA person must see God's hand in every situation and realize that there's a master plan, even at times when it is hard to comprehend. For example, you decide to start learning Torah every day before Shacharis. The next morning, you go out to the car bright and early, turn the key and nothing happens. The car is dead. You think to yourself \"Why now? I don't deserve this! I am only doing this for you - God!\" We have to learn from Yosef. Yosef's faith in God was iron-clad in every situation; whether his brothers wanted to kill him or whether he was thrown into prison for defeating his evil inclination, he understood that everything was for his good."},{ID:15,parshaId:10,vort:'Yosef harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Yisrael his father in Goshen.

Yosef went out to greet his father, falling on his neck weeping. Yaakov, however, did not fall on Yosef\'s neck, nor did he kiss him. Why not? The Midrash reveals that Yaakov was reciting Shema. Of all the times to say the Shema, he had to say it now - when he was finally reunited with his long-lost son!? Couldn\'t he have had better itinerary planning? And if it was now the halachic time to say Shema, why didn\'t Yosef say it as well?/\r\n\r\nEmotions can be channeled in different ways. An actor who feels anxious and tense before a play can channel those feelings into high-powered energy and produce an incredible performance. The same is true for channeling our emotions to the service of God. When Yaakov saw Yosef after a long and painful separation, he experienced an outpouring of love and joy. He felt that instead of focusing purely on the joy of seeing his son, he should channel this love towards God, and so he immediately recited Shema./\r\n\r\nCharacter traits can also be redirected to better serve God. We find that both King David and Eisav were born with a tendency towards bloodshed. David utilized it for the good - he killed only in accordance with the rulings of the Sanhedrin, thus fulfilling God\'s will. Eisav, on the other hand, would kill whenever the mood moved him and became the eternal symbol of cruelty and evil./\r\n\r\nGod created man with the ability to experience many emotions, and He wants us to use them to get closer to Him. How sad it is when people cry watching movies, wasting their precious tears on something that never even happened! The Talmud states, "If a person encounters the evil inclination, he should drag him into the Beis Hamidrash (study hall)." The Ben Yehoyada explains, "If a sudden wave of physical desire overcomes a person, "He should bring it to the Bais Midrash" - instead of using the desire for something negative, he should hurry to utilize this energy for spiritual pursuits - the performance of a mitzva or the study of Torah.'},{ID:16,parshaId:11,vort:"Reuven, you are my firstborn...

It was a hasty recklessness like that of fast-flowing waters which rush ahead and cause damage without a thought to the consequences.\"/\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand this, for Reuven did not mean to sin; to the contrary, he thought he was acting righteously, defending his mother's honor.

When a bewildered onlooker asked him why he did not cry out, he answered that the student would have felt incredible embarrassment about having caused him pain, and therefore he controlled himself and kept quiet./\r\n\r\nReuven forfeited these privileges not because of his actions but because of what caused him to act the way he did - the attribute of impulsiveness. A leader cannot be impulsive. He must think through his decisions and consider their consequences. One first has to take responsibility for himself before he can take responsibility for others. To act without first thinking is a sign that one is not in control of himself and not fit to be a leader."},{ID:17,parshaId:12,vort:"She opened it and saw him, the boy, and behold!

She took pity on him and said, \u201cThis is one of the Hebrew boys.\u201d (Exodus 2:6)/\r\n\r\nPharaoh\u2019s daughter went to bathe by the river and noticed a little casket floating in the water. The verse states that she opened the casket and saw the \u201cyeled\u201d, boy, and behold a \u201cnaar\u201d, youth, was crying. She then realized that it was a Jewish baby. Why does the verse switch from boy to youth, and how did she work out that it was a Jewish baby just because he was crying?/\r\n\r\nThe Baal Haturim explains that the verse is actually referring to two separate individuals. She opened the casket and saw the boy \u2013 Moshe. She then noticed that the youth was crying \u2013 Aharon. When she saw one brother crying for another she realized that it must be a Jew!/\r\n\r\nThe Rebbe of Kapishnitz {R\u2019 Avraham Yehoshua Heschel}, once visited one of his wealthy followers. The Rebbe knocked on the door. The wealthy man opened his door and was taken aback at the sight of the holy Rebbe standing at his door step. He asked in bewilderment, \u201cWhy did the Rebbe have to trouble himself to come to my home? The Rebbe could have summoned me and I would have come at once!\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe Rebbe answered, \u201cI know of a certain family that is in desperate need of help.

Their expenses are well beyond their means.\u201d/\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Rebbe,\u201d the wealthy man said, \u201cdid this necessitate you having to exert yourself by traveling to my home? Why did the Rebbe not simply send me a messenger, and I would have gladly given whatever sum of money that was needed!\u201d \u201cThis particular request is of great importance to me,\u201d the Rebbe responded. \u201cIt was therefore essential that I come to your home personally.\u201d/\r\n\r\n\u201cI am prepared to give as much money as necessary!\u201d the man exclaimed. \u201cJust tell me, whom shall I make the check payable to?\u201d The Rebbe paused and said, \u201cMake the check payable\u2026 to your brother!!\u201d/\r\n\r\nOften one wants to help others and searches far and wide for opportunities to do so, but he may find himself ignoring his own family members. A way to test whether you really care about others or whether you\u2019re helping them just for recognition is by examining the way you help at home. Real kindness starts with your own brother!"},{ID:18,parshaId:13,vort:"This was the Aaron and Moshe... (Ex. 6:26)/\r\n\r\nRashi notes that in some places the Torah mentions Moshe before Aharon and in other places (such as our verse) it mentions Aharon before Moshe. This teaches us that both were equally great./\r\n\r\nThis is puzzling, since the Torah itself testifies that Moshe was the greatest prophet who ever lived; how can it be said that Aharon was equal to him?/\r\n\r\nIn God's eyes, achievement is measured by whether a person fulfills his personal mission. One who has a small mission but completes it is just as great as one with a big mission who completes it. Aharon achieved the absolute maximum of his potential; he fulfilled God's will perfectly just as Moshe did. The difference was that Moshe had more missions, which meant that he had more responsibilities. Still, since they both did as they were commanded in accordance with their abilities, they were on an equal level./\r\n\r\nPeople can tend to get disheartened that they cannot accomplish as much as their peers. If a person doesn't have the intelligence and capabilities of others, he has to understand that more talent simply means greater responsibility. Rav Yisroel Salanter used to say: \"I know that in many ways I have the capacity of 1,000 men, but because of this, my obligation to serve Hashem is also that of one thousand men.\" As long as one is maximizing his potential he is just as great as everyone else."},{ID:19,parshaId:14,vort:"And so that you may relate in the ears of your son and your son's son that I made mockery of Egypt and my signs that I placed among them - that you may know that I am Hashem.

If the purpose of the plagues was to compel Pharaoh to send the Jews from Egypt, why couldn't one massive plague suffice?/\r\n\r\nWhen one makes food for his own consumption, he knows exactly what he wants. He knows the type of food, the quantity and the spices that he likes. However, when one makes food to sell he doesn't know everyone's taste so he needs to make a variety of dishes to ensure that there will be something for everyone./\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the plagues was to teach the children of Israel, as well as all future generations, that God is not a distant, uninterested Creator - rather, He is the master and sustainer of the universe day by day. The people were to relate all the miracles to their children, and their children to their children and so on. Since different people are impressed and amazed by different things, God performed a variety of miracles to ensure that everyone would be impressed and pass it down to the next generation./\r\n\r\nEvery person has his own personality and own way of looking at things. Some children have a more creative mind while others have an easier time remembering information. Every child is fascinated by something else. Hence, every child needs to be raised accordingly.

Birds came and ate all the manna they had spread before the Bnei Yisroel woke up. Had the people seen even a small amount of manna on Shabbos after Moses had said that it wouldn't fall might have caused a tremendous amount of confusion, which could have led to a rebellion against Moses. Once a year we show appreciation to the birds by feeding them bread./\r\n\r\nBirds naturally eat. By eating all the manna they didn't do anything that goes against their nature. In fact they didn't even know that they were doing a great kindness, they just saw bread and ate it. Why then do we reward them yearly?/\r\n\r\nIt is true that birds eat, and eating the manna was not an act against their nature. However, because the eating of the manna was favorable for us, we need to be grateful for it. Being grateful is not dependent on what drove the benefactor to do the act; rather it is for the one receiving the kindness to show appreciation - regardless of the intentions of the giver./\r\n\r\nFocusing on what you're lacking leads to misery. When one has a sore throat he can focus on his throat - which will then make him gloomy, or he can focus on the fact that he's breathing fine, his business is going smooth...

(Ex. 19:2)/\r\n\r\nIn the Pesach Haggadah it states, "Had He {God} brought us before Har Sinai, but not given us the Torah, it would have been sufficient." These words are difficult to understand, for what would simply arriving at Har Sinai accomplish if it would not have resulted in our receiving the Torah?/\r\n\r\nRashi points out that the word "vayichan" is in the singular, despite the fact that the Torah was describing the encampment of millions of Jews. Rashi explains that at this particular encampment the Jewish people were united - "as one man, with one heart." Upon arriving in the desert of Sinai, they put an end to all quarrelling, cleansing their hearts from all ill will, and they shared a deep love for one another. The unity that the Jewish people achieved would have been worthwhile even had they not received the Torah!/\r\n\r\nFor Israel to rise to its highest calling, for us to reach perfection, we must act as one entity and not as a bunch of individuals. Furthermore, when people are united, God does not harm them. As we see in the story of the tower of Babel, the Torah tells us that God said, "Behold, they are one people with one language for all." Since they were united God did not destroy them. Instead, He said, "Come let us descend there and confuse their language." Because they could not understand each other, the builders of the tower began to fight, became untied, and Hashem then harmed them./\r\n\r\nUnity comes about when one puts his personal worries to the side and concerns himself with his friend. The difference between united and untied is where you place the "I". When you place the "I" to the side and you are more concerned for your friend - unity is the result.'},{ID:22,parshaId:17,vort:'If you take your fellow\'s garment as security, until sunset shall you return it to him. ...so it will be that if he cries out to Me, I shall listen, for I am compassionate. (Ex. 22:25-26)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah commands us to lend money to our fellow Jews. If the borrower does not repay, the lender may ask the court that he be given an item as collateral. However, the lender must return the collateral to the borrower at the times when he needs it. If the lender does not return it, he will be punished since God listens to the cries of the borrower./\r\n\r\nOne may ask: the lender has rights to an object of the borrowers. He needs to insure that he gets his money back. What then is the sin of not returning the collateral to the borrower when he needs it - the lender should be able to demand his money back if the borrower has to have his collateral?/\r\n\r\nGod gives a person more than what he needs for survival, merely for helping and giving to others. A person must look at the spare money he has as a deposit from God to assist the needy. Therefore, in a sense the lender has an obligation to lend out his extra money and doesn\'t deserve any collateral for it. However, the Torah has given him rights to take collateral so that he can keep lending his money to others. Still, when the borrower needs the coat the lender has to return it - out of the knowledge that nothing, even his own possession, is truly his./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud(2) relates that Turnus Rufus, the Roman Governor of Judea, asked Rabbi Akiva: "If your God loves the poor, why does He not support them?" Rabbi Akiva replied, "So that we may be saved from the punishment of Hell by giving charity." God gives me extra so that I can gain by helping others. With this in mind, when someone comes and asks to borrow something, instead of making up a poor excuse try lending it out and saying "Thank you for giving me this opportunity!"'},{ID:23,parshaId:18,vort:"You shall make a menorah of pure gold, hammered out shall the menorah be made. (Ex. 25:31)/\r\n\r\nGod commanded Moshe to make a menorah by fashioning it out of a single bar of gold. Moshe could not visualize the menorah, and so God showed him a vision of a menorah of fire. However, Moshe still found it difficult to make. God then told him to throw the bar of gold into the fire, give it one blow with the hammer, and a finished menorah would emerge! Moshe threw the gold into the fire, hit it with the hammer and prayed to Hashem. Immediately, the complete menorah emerged from the fire. There is an obvious difficulty with this: if God knew that Moshe was not going to be able to actually make the menorah by himself, why did He show him the heavenly vision first?/\r\n\r\nWhen you get into your car and you turn on the G.P.S. the first instruction is: ENTER YOUR DESTINATION. In order to get anywhere in life, you need to have a goal; a vision of where you are heading. You have to first know what you want, before it can happen. Similarly, you can't pray and expect heavenly assistance if you don't have a clear vision of what you are looking for. Therefore, God had to show Moshe a vision of what he was supposed to accomplish, and only then could Moshe pray for heavenly assistance in the making of the menorah./\r\n\r\nThe Alter of Kelm explains how righteous people of previous generations became such great people. It was because they knew the power of setting goals, and had visions of what they aspired to reach. The evil inclination is able to persuade someone to sin by placing immoral fantasies in his mind. The only way to fight him is by using his own weapon against him - one needs to use the imagination to envision greatness. A person can learn mussar but still retain his flaws. In order to really change, one needs to envision the great person he would like to be. When the great sage Rebbe Akiva Eiger was asked how he became who he was, he replied that he strove to become like the Rashba {a great Rabbi who lived hundreds of years before him}, and therefore he was able to become Rebbe Eiger.

These bells tinkled to announce the Kohen Gadol's arrival in the Mishkan and his departure from it./\r\n\r\nWe learn from the fact that the Kohen Gadol's entry was announced by bells that a person should not enter his own home unexpectedly. This shows us the importance of being sensitive and respectful to other people./\r\n\r\nThe Mishnah in Avos (4:3) states \"Do not be scornful of any person.\" One must not insult people, verbally or otherwise. Even the most inferior person must be treated respectfully, regardless of whether you understand their issues or not./\r\n\r\nThe key to interpersonal relationships is to try and place yourself in your friends' shoes and see things from his perspective. For example, when it's hot outside and your roommate insists on the window being closed at night, try to understand his concerns - catching a cold and waking up sick the next morning. When your manager screams at you for not meeting the deadline, before you get insulted and begin to resent him, realize he must be under tremendous pressure. You'll understand him for acting the way he did since you would probably act the same way if you were under that much pressure!/\r\n\r\nBeing sensitive to others can sometimes raise their spirits and affect their lives in a big way. \"Although it's nice to be important, it's more important to be nice!\""},{ID:25,parshaId:20,vort:"However, you must observe my Shabbos, for it is a sign between Me and you for your generations, to know that I am Hashem, Who makes you holy.

You hop over to the pizza shop and the lights are off - the store is closed. \"Interesting,\" you think to yourself, \"they are never closed at this time.\" A few days later you pass by in the morning and again it's closed. You figure that the owner must be away on vacation. A week later it's still closed. You assume that they must be renovating. One day you pass by and you see that the sign \"Delicious Pizza\" has been removed. You now understand that the store has closed down. Once the sign is removed you know it no longer exists./\r\n\r\nShabbos is the cornerstone of our faith and is equivalent to all of the commandments, for through the commandment of Shabbos one expresses his belief that God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Observing Shabbos indicates that one believes in the Creator. When one desecrates Shabbos he's removing his sign of being a believing Jew./\r\n\r\nShabbos helps us understand our place in the world. During the week human beings are busy building and changing the world. Every seven days we stop, we pull back from building the world and remind ourselves that we are not God. In ceasing from all creative activity we make the statement to ourselves and to humanity that although we can manipulate the world, we don't own it; the universe belongs to God./\r\n\r\nShabbos is not a day of restrictions; it's a day of opportunity.

Where did they acquire the skills necessary?/\r\n\r\nDeep inside every person there are hidden talents which can be tapped into when one has a real desire to achieve something. The people who stepped forward to work in the mishkan did not know that they had such skills.

She replied, "The light of the world just went out; your grandfather Rashi passed away."/\r\n\r\nThe little boy thought for a moment and said, "Mommy, I\'m going to re-ignite that light!"

Moshe gave the Jewish People a calculation of how he had used every single ounce of gold, silver and copper which had been contributed.

They opened the first letter and discovered the following message: "My last request is that I should be buried wearing my socks." Even though his children were perplexed by such a request, they still tried to honor it. They fought hard, but the Rabbis would not allow it and buried him without his socks. After the month had passed, his children anxiously opened up the second letter to discover another message: "I know that you did not bury me wearing my socks as I had requested, since it is against Halacha, Jewish Law. You are most probably wondering why, then, did I request it in the first place. My answer to you, my dear children, is to teach you an eternal lesson: a person can spend his life amassing a great amount of possessions and money, but no matter how hard he tries, he cannot even take his socks with him to the next world!

Why is one obligated to bring salt as part of a sacrifice, as opposed to honey?/\r\n\r\nEven though honey and salt are both used for flavoring food there is a fundamental difference between them. Honey itself is sweet and when poured on food, it provides the food with a sweet taste. Salt, however, enhances flavor, pulling the flavor out of food and giving it a stronger taste. It can be added to something bland and make it flavorful./\r\n\r\nThe symbolism of the obligation to use salt on the offerings as opposed to honey teaches us that God wants every person to develop and nurture his own unique talents. This is like a good teacher who doesn\u2019t merely put information into the student - rather he brings out and develops what\u2019s already there./\r\n\r\nThe Zohar states that the word \u201cYisrael\u201d is an acronym for there are six hundred thousand letters in the Torah. This number corresponds to the six hundred thousand men who left Egypt. Every Jew is a letter in the Torah. If there is one letter in a Torah scroll that is touching another letter that Torah is invalid, and so too, a Jew who ignores his own abilities and tries to be like others is \u2018invalid\u2019.

Should it not be the Jews who praise God for saving them?! The Netziv replied, "We have no way of knowing the extent of your conspiracies against us.

However, the kosher form of chessed is to bestow kindness equally on all people, regardless of how similar they are to us. The chassidah acts kindly toward its companions, but only towards its companions. It does not act kindly towards anyone else.

Why is the sin of lashon hara so severe that it must be punished with tzaraas?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah states, "And [God] blew into his nostrils the soul of life; and man became a living being." (Bereishis 2:7) Onkelos translates "a living being" as a "speaking spirit." Accordingly, it is the soul that gives a person the power to speak. Because the soul and the ability to speak are directly connected, great damage is done to the soul when someone sins through speech. Lashon hara is therefore punished severely and instantaneously./\r\n\r\nRabban Shimon ben Gamliel once sent his servant, Tavi, to buy "good food." Tavi, who was famous for his wisdom, brought back a tongue. Thereupon, Rav Shimon sent him to buy some "bad food." Again he returned with a tongue. Rav Shimon asked him to explain how the same food could be both good and bad. Tavi answered, "From a tongue can come good and bad. When a tongue speaks good, by complimenting or praising another, there is nothing better. But when a tongue speaks evil, when it tells lashon hara or makes fun of people, there is nothing worse. It can break up families and kill./\r\n\r\nThe verse states, "Death and life are in the hands of the tongue." (Mishlei 18:21) The tongue is mightier than the sword. A sword can only kill someone nearby, whereas words spoken on one continent can "hit the heart" of someone on another continent. The tongue, of all the limbs and organs, moves with the least difficulty and most speed. Consequently, lashon hara is one of the sins committed most frequently. It is for this reason that the mouth is guarded with two gates: the teeth and the lips. A person has to think twice before he says something once.

Michael Jordan, possibly the greatest basketball player of all time, is described as \"single-handedly redefining the NBA superstar,\" and yet to get there he admits to failing more than most. He is quoted as saying: \"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty six times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over in my life.\"/\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say the reason he has succeeded boils down to his constant failure and using failure as his motivation to shoot for success. In other words, Jordan viewed failures as stepping stones towards success; his shooting average was just below 50% so to score he would have to take two shots, one to miss and the other to score./\r\n\r\nDo you despair from your failures or view them as a chance for a rebound?"},{ID:33,parshaId:28,vort:"Aaron shall come to the tent of meeting - he shall remove the linen vestments that he had worn when he entered the sanctuary...

Whenever he would don those white vestments or change into his regular vestments he immersed himself in a mikveh. One normally immerses when he's in the process of elevating himself. If so, why did the Kohen Gadol immerse himself when he changed back into his regular vestments - wasn't he decreasing his level of holiness by changing back into his regular clothes?/\r\n\r\nEvery good deed is supposed to elevate a person and bring him to new heights.

All the commandments you perform should be on a higher level than before.\r\nAfter the Kohen Gadol wore the holy white garments he became so elevated that even the regular service he performed afterwards was on a higher level. The regular service went up a notch and he therefore immersed himself before donning his regular vestments./\r\n\r\nIn life a person needs to keep climbing to greater heights.

(Lev. 19:17)/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud (1) teaches that one must reprove over and over, even a hundred times. It may be unwise to tell someone bluntly how wrong his actions are, for it will probably antagonize him. How, then, do we understand this statement from the Talmud which requires us to reprove our fellow a hundred times?/\r\n\r\nPeople abhor criticism. No one enjoys hearing that what they're doing is wrong. In order to give rebuke in the correct manner one must have a proper strategy. By telling us to rebuke even a hundred times, our Sages are teaching us how to give rebuke: one should break up the criticism into a hundred small parts. This way a person can draw the object of rebuke closer to his point of view in a palatable way, one step at a time. Only in this manner will the person be able to hear that what he's doing is wrong, and thus be willing to effect a change./\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is important to have the right attitude when giving rebuke. If your intention is to set him straight only because it is bothering you, your rebuke will almost certainly fail./\r\n\r\nA Rabbi once told over a story about a student in the Chofetz Chaim's yeshiva who used to smoke on Shabbos. All the guys would scream at him to stop, but it was to no avail. One day he got a message that the Chofetz Chaim wanted to see him in the office. There was a big commotion in the yeshiva - the Chofetz Chaim had found out that he was smoking on Shabbos! The student went into the office, and came out two minutes later. After that, he never touched a cigarette again. No one knew what the Chofetz Chaim had told him, but in two minutes he accomplished something that throughout the years no one else had been able to accomplish!/\r\n\r\nAfter the Rabbi finished speaking, an elderly man came over and said  I was the boy that was caught smoking on Shabbos. The Rabbi asked, So what did the Chofetz Chaim tell you? The man replied, When I was called into the office, I started to tremble; I didn't know what to say. I came into the office and there the Chofetz Chaim was. My feet started to shake. He motioned for me to come around the desk. I came around and he held on to my hand, not saying anything. He then looked at me and just said two words slowly: 'Shabbos Shabbos.' As he spoke, two tears dripped down from his eyes on to my arm, which pierced a hole right through my heart! He wasn't just telling me off, like I felt everyone else was doing. Rather, I could see that he really cared about me and the honor of Shabbos. I decided right then and there never to smoke on Shabbos again!/\r\n\r\nThis is the way one gives rebuke. We need to analyze our motives before giving reproof and work on really feeling for the person."},{ID:35,parshaId:30,vort:'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: God\'s appointed festivals\u2026 For six days labor may be done, and the seventh day is a day of complete rest. (Lev. 23:2)/\r\n\r\nGod is about to teach Moshe the laws of the festivals. Right before it lists the festivals the Torah mentions Shabbos. Why does the Torah introduce the chapter of festivals with Shabbos?/\r\n\r\nThere are two steps to emunah (belief). The first step is knowing that the world has a Creator. One has to know that at first there was nothing, until God spoke and brought all of reality into being. The second step is to know that God is involved in the actual running of the world. Every issue - whether big or small - involves Hashem. He is orchestrating all events at all times./\r\n\r\nShabbos bears testimony to the fact that God created heaven and earth, while the festivals, which recall the miracles of the exodus, testify that God controls nature on an ongoing basis and can change it at will. By placing Shabbos together with the festivals the Torah is teaching us that both concepts are equally essential to the faith of a Jew. Belief in one step without the other is not considered emunah. It is heretical to think that God created the universe, but then "stepped back" and left it to the unfettered laws of nature or in the control of angels or other powers. Emunah is knowing that God is the Creator and Sustainer.'},{ID:36,parshaId:31,vort:"I will ordain my blessing for you in the sixth year and it will yield a crop sufficient for the three year period. (Lev. 25:21)/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that one who does not till his fields during the Shemittah (seventh) year is a mighty warrior. God bestows blessings of bounty upon such an individual: in the sixth year his field produces enough food to last for three years - the sixth, seventh and eighth years. Why is the farmer considered a mighty warrior if he has plenty of food for himself and his family?/\r\n\r\nDaniel walked into a suit store and tried on a few different suits, but the prices exceeded his $300 budget. Also, he could see nothing he particularly liked, so he headed for the door. On his way out a salesman said, \"Hey, wait a minute! We'll find you something just perfect.\" He brought over a suit that Daniel had already tried on, but Daniel agreed to try it on again. The salesman looked at him and said, \"Wow, this suit looks really good on you. It fits like a glove. You look really slick!\"/\r\n\r\nDaniel took a look in the mirror and started to think, \"Two minutes ago I didn't like it, but now it's starting to look really nice.\" He asked the salesman the price./\r\n\r\nThe salesman told him, \"It's $400.\" After a pause, he added, \"Listen, this suit is made from the finest materials; you won't find this anywhere else...\"/\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Daniel walked out of the store with a big smile thinking he had bought the nicest suit in town\u2026 Even though everyone knows that salesmen are just trying to make a sale, we are still easily convinced by them./\r\n\r\nIn the sixth year, when a person's field produces three times the normal amount, the evil inclination comes knocking on his door and says, \"You have an incredible field. In one year it produced three times the normal amount. Next year you'll work the field and then it will produce 3 times the amount as well! Before you know it you'll be rich! To stop working your field now for a full year would be extremely foolish.\" Deep down the person knows that his field produced so much because of the Torah's promise, but the evil inclination sounds so convincing. Someone that can overcome such a challenge is a mighty warrior!/ \r\n\r\nHuman beings are very easily influenced and affected by surroundings and peer pressure. We change our minds from one minute to the next. A strong person is one who sticks to his convictions; he does what he knows deep down to be the truth, and doesn't buy into the media's views or beliefs. He doesn't get swayed by others!"},{ID:37,parshaId:32,vort:'Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand. (Lev. 26:8)/\r\n\r\nThe Parshah begins with the blessings that await the Jewish people if they keep their covenant with God: five Jews will pursue a hundred enemies, and a hundred Jews will pursue 10,000. Rashi asks: if five Jews can pursue a hundred enemies, a ratio of 1:20, then shouldn\'t one hundred Jews pursue 2,000, not 10,000?/\r\n\r\nIt is said that if one person can lift 50 pounds, two people together can lift three times that amount: 150 pounds. As the verse states, "Two are better than one." Two people together can accomplish a lot more than just two individuals. When more people are united in serving God their actions are more effective. Each individual in the group reaches a far higher level than he would have had he acted alone, no matter how hard he has worked. The Chofetz Chaim points out that we see this in bircas hamazon. When three people recite Grace after Meals together, they say "let us bless," but when ten people recite it, they say, "let us bless our God" - they reach a higher level./\r\n\r\nWhen a community is actively involved in the pursuit of Torah and Mitzvos one should not separate himself from them since he is thereby preventing them from reaching higher levels and accomplishing greater things. The word "TEAM" stands for: Together, Everyone Accomplishes More!'},{ID:38,parshaId:33,vort:"All their countings were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty. (Num. 1:46)/\r\n\r\nA man passed away and left over a will for his children. The will stated that in a certain town on a particular street he had left 10 million dollars buried there. The sons immediately gathered up the necessary equipment and set out for that town. After much effort they found the exact street and began digging. They dug and labored for several hours but they turned up empty handed. They continued digging for several days and all they found was a few hundred dollars. Their backs were aching and their hands were sore but they did not give up; they kept on digging. They were sure that all the money was there; it was just a matter of time until they would find it./\r\n\r\nOne may think, \"Even if I toil and learn Torah sincerely I will never get anywhere. Studying Torah is just not my thing.\" But the truth is that there is a portion in the Torah that resonates with every person. It may be buried deep down but it's there. If you have not yet felt any connection with Torah it means that you haven't dug deep enough. You need to keep on digging! It is for this reason that this week's Torah portion is always read immediately prior to the holiday Shavuot. The portion mentions an accounting of the Jews to show us that each and every individual is significant and has a portion in Torah./\r\n\r\nEach person has their own way of thinking and their own way of looking at things. There are so many paths and so many angles in Torah that there isn't a single portion in Torah that a person can't have a natural love for. God created the Torah for us to connect with him, so there must be parts and places in there where that connection will happen."},{ID:39,parshaId:34,vort:"The leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' household, brought offerings... (Num. 7:2)/\r\n\r\nThis week's Torah portion describes at length the offerings of the Nesi'im (the leaders of the tribes) on the day that the Mishkan was inaugurated. Every Nasi offered the same offering. The Torah describes each Nasi's offering separately in virtually identical verses. Why could the Torah not simply mention the offerings the first time and then just say that the other Nesi'im brought the exact same offerings?/\r\n\r\nA man was once on a speaking tour and prepared long and hard for his first speech. The speech was entertaining and engaging - a big success. The next night he was scheduled to speak in another town, and he planned on giving the same talk. He was about to begin speaking when he noticed that some of the people present had heard him lecture the night before! He couldn't possibly give the same speech, so he quickly put a couple of ideas together and came up with a new one. However, it didn't compare to the previous night. After the speech he approached the repeat customers and apologized for not giving them a well-prepared speech. Disappointed, they replied, \"You don't understand. We enjoyed last night so much that we came back to hear the same exact speech; we didn't want to hear a different one!\"/\r\n\r\nThe Torah is telling us that each Nasi who brought a sacrifice - even though it was identical to the previous Nasi's - in God's eyes it was like the first one he received. The sacrifice of every single Nasi was special to Him./\r\n\r\nSometimes we may feel that we are constantly doing the same exact thing over and over again, whether the prayers that we say day in day out or the mitzvos that we perform, and we may lose that initial enthusiasm. However, we must realize that every time we perform our duty God takes pleasure in it as if we had never done it before."},{ID:40,parshaId:35,vort:'He {God} said, "Please hear my words..." (Num. 12:6)/\r\n\r\nMiriam and Aharon spoke lashon hara, derogatory speech, against Moshe. Although they had not acted with malice, in fact speaking more out of concern for Moshe\'s welfare, God\'s anger flared up and He rebuked them. However, when God addressed them He spoke in a very soft tone, starting: "Please hear My words..." The Sifsei Chachamim explains that even though God was angry at Miriam and Aharon, He still spoke to them in a soft tone, for if He would have spoken to them in a harsh and angry tone, His words would not have been heeded./\r\n\r\nWhen a person is spoken to harshly he feels under attack. His pride is at stake and he therefore does not fully hear what is being said. If God was careful in how He spoke to Miriam and Aharon who were prophets, then how much more so should we speak carefully to our spouses, colleagues or acquaintances. Even when one must confront an enemy, or admonish someone for a terrible misdeed, one should speak gently, for gentle words have a greater effect than words that are shouted and screamed. King Solomon teaches "A soft answer turns away wrath." While one provocative remark can kindle anger, even the most intense fury can be soothed by a gentle word. Always remember: the louder the word the quieter it is heard.'},{ID:41,parshaId:36,vort:"And they shall place upon the tzitzis of each corner a thread of turquoise wool. (Num. 15:38)/\r\n\r\nThe weekly Torah portion concludes with the commandment of tzitzis, the commandment that helps one focus on his duties to God. As the Rabbis explain, the blue strand of wool reminds one of the ocean which is blue, which then reminds one of the sky, which is reminiscent of God's throne of glory. The question is why we need all these steps. We should put some resemblance of God on the tzitzis and go straight to the top. With all these steps we might never get to the top - we'll lose focus along the way!/\r\n\r\nAs a baby matures it goes through various stages: turning over, sitting up, crawling and finally walking. Many times, if the baby goes straight from the sitting stage to walking, they'll still teach it how to crawl. Any stage that it misses can greatly affect its capabilities later on in life. Every stage the baby goes through is necessary in developing another part of the brain./\r\n\r\nThe Torah is teaching us that the same concept exists in spirituality. Growth needs to be systematic. One needs to go through every stage, step by step, until he can get to the top. In every stage he develops skills which are needed to make him a complete person./\r\n\r\nQuite often one gets inspired and wants to become great overnight. In order for it to really last, a person needs to move at slow increments until each step becomes a part of him. For example, if he wants to improve his prayer and have stronger concentration, he needs to start with one small segment until he masters it, then moving on, as opposed to trying to master the whole thing at once. Growth is made up of lots of small steps, eventually leading to greatness."},{ID:42,parshaId:37,vort:'Korach son of Izhar son of Kehas son of Levi took... (Num. 13:27)/\r\n\r\nKorach possessed many outstanding qualities. He hailed from a distinguished family, and was a wise man. How could he fall so low as to accuse Moshe of selfishly taking power and prestige for himself? The Torah testifies about Moshe, "Now the man Moshe was exceedingly humble, more than any person on the face of the earth." How could Korach possibly accuse him of seeking honor!?/\r\n\r\nThere are two types of people. There are givers - people who are constantly looking for opportunities to assist others, and there are takers - people who are continuously looking to further add to their possessions, to satisfy their own needs and obtain more honor. The takers are never satisfied; they always desire more. At the very beginning of Korach\'s story the Torah reveals the root of his downfall: "Korach took." -- Korach was a taker; he wanted more honor for himself. Even though he was already privileged to be in the tribe of Levi, that wasn\'t enough for him. He needed more. He wanted a prominent communal position and was jealous of the honor that Moshe and Aharon were getting. His jealousy knew no bounds and Korach did whatever he could to obtain that honor, even though it meant starting a rebellion./\r\n\r\nWhen someone is self-centered and has a particular desire, his intellect may get corrupted, preventing him from thinking rationally. Blinded by this desire, he will do anything. In order to avoid such a downfall he should work on assisting others and become a giver.'},{ID:43,parshaId:38,vort:'Speak to the rock before their eyes that it shall give its waters\u2026 Then Moshe raised his arm and struck the rock. (Num. 20:8,11)/\r\n\r\nMoshe was commanded to bring forth water from the rock by talking to it, but he erred and instead struck the rock twice until water poured forth. This sin caused Moshe to lose the privilege of entering the Land of Israel with the nation. Rashi explains that God had commanded Moshe to speak to the rock that had given them water before, but he could not find it. He spoke to a different rock, but nothing happened. He then proceeded to hit the rock which subsequently produced water./\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that Moshe listened to God and spoke to the rock - he just couldn\'t find it! Why was he then punished, being found at fault for not recognizing the rock?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah demands of us to recognize our benefactors and to appreciate them. The Egyptians had greatly harmed the Jewish people, but we are enjoined not to treat them similarly. The reason is because Egypt had provided food and lodging when Yaakov and his family resided there. That alone is enough for us to be thankful. The rock that had been providing the Jews with water for 40 years as they wandered in the desert should have been easily recognizable amongst the other rocks! Not recognizing that rock is considered a lack of appreciation and a grave sin./\r\n\r\nThe first thing a Jew starts his day with is gratitude: "Modeh ani l\'fonecha..."- "I gratefully thank you, O living and eternal King, for You have returned my soul within me with compassion\u2026" Being grateful is the very fiber of a Jew. The Hebrew word for Jew is Yehudi which also means one who thanks. Gratitude helps one focus and take pleasure in what he has rather than concentrate on what he\'s lacking - which is the key to being a happy person.'},{ID:44,parshaId:39,vort:'The she-donkey said to Bilaam, "Am I not your she-donkey that you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been accustomed to do such a thing to you?" (Num. 22:30)/\r\n\r\nImagine you\'re on the way home from a wedding late at night. You\'ve been traveling many hours and you\'re wiped out. All you can think of is crawling into bed. You are nearing your house when suddenly you spot your neighbor\'s car blocking your driveway. You become enraged. "How could he do something like that, he knows I need to park my car!!" You circle the block for 10 minutes until you find parking, while thinking about how to retaliate against your neighbor./\r\n\r\nYou then remember that the Torah says to judge others favorably and give them the benefit of the doubt. But you think, "How is it possible to give him the benefit of the doubt - he knows I need to park my car and nevertheless he blocked the driveway?!"/\r\n\r\nBilam was riding his donkey on the way to curse the Jews when the donkey stopped moving, refusing to budge. Bilam struck it. The donkey, suddenly able to speak, asked in bewilderment, "Hey, what was that for?!" Bilam said, "You\'re lucky I don\'t have my sword on me, otherwise I would have killed you!"/\r\n\r\nThe donkey replied, "Bilam, have I ever betrayed you? Have I been accustomed to do such a thing to you? Why in the world would you think that I\'m trying to hurt you and prevent you from going?!"/\r\n\r\nThe donkey was telling Bilam to focus on the one doing the apparent "evil" and not to zoom in on the isolated incident. If the perpetrator is not accustomed to betraying you then it\'s more rational to assume that some far-out scenario must be taking place. In the case of the donkey, Bilam should have realized that there was something unusual going on. In fact there was an angel blocking the path which prevented the donkey from proceeding./\r\n\r\nThe same logic applies to your neighbor blocking the driveway. Since this action is not in character with your neighbor, it is more rational to assume that some emergency came up than to assume that he just did not care about you and prevented you from parking your car./\r\n\r\nBy giving people the benefit of the doubt, our lives, relationships and daily interactions will become more positive and successful - making the world a better place.'},{ID:45,parshaId:40,vort:"The name of the slain Israelite man who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, leader of a father's house Simeonites. (Num. 25:14)/\r\n\r\nAt the end of Parshas Balak the Torah relates that a Jew, in a shocking act of brazenness, brought a Midianite woman to Moshe and sinned with her in public view. Pinchas seized a spear and killed both the man and woman. In the beginning of Parshas Pinchas the Torah proceeds to reveal the identity of that man: Zimri the son of Salu. Why does the Torah wait until now to reveal to us who this man was?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person sees someone else sin, his sensitivities weaken and it is easier for him to sin as well. This is even more the case when the person who sins is regarded highly in society. Zimri held a high position; he was the leader of his tribe and one of the great people of the generation. Had the Torah mentioned at the time of the sin that the person sinning was Zimri, it would have had a tremendous negative influence on the people. People would reason, \"If such a great person can do something like that, then surely I can!\" Therefore the Torah waited until Pinchas killed him and demonstrated that such a sin is not tolerated no matter who you are. Now revealing the sinner would not have any harmful impact./\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates the magnitude a person's actions can have, affecting others positively or negatively. People watch what you do and follow suit. Even better than reproving others is to rectify one's own actions. If you have a big cup with a bunch of little cups surrounding it, there are two ways to fill up the cups. Either pour into each cup individually, or pour into the big cup, allowing it to overflow into all the small cups. When a person is overflowing with kindness, everyone around him becomes kinder./\r\n\r\nThe Chofetz Chaim used to say that in his younger years he wanted to perfect the world. That didn't work so he figured he would work to perfect Lithuania. That also didn't work so he decided that he would just perfect Radin, which again failed. He finally decided that he would just try to perfect himself. By perfecting himself he then influenced Radin, the whole of Lithuania and Jews worldwide!/\r\n\r\nIf other people's negative actions disturb you, you do not have to reprove them constantly. For example, if people come late to shul or are not sensitive with their speech, you can be extra careful in those areas and this will cause a change in them. Be the change that you want to see in the world!\r\n\r\n"},{ID:46,parshaId:41,vort:"Moshe was angry with the commanders of the army... (Num. 31:14)/\r\n\r\nThe laws of koshering utensils were transmitted by Elazar and not by Moshe because Moshe had become angry and forgot the laws. The difficulty with this is that Moshe was certainly justified in getting angry. God told the Jews to wage a war against Midian, who were responsible for causing the Jews to commit acts of immorality and idolatry. The troops killed all the males but spared the Midianite women - the ones who were primarily responsible for inciting those sins. Moshe thus became angry at the officers who allowed this. Why then was he punished?/\r\n\r\nImagine that you try to open your car door and the key won't turn. You begin to get frustrated and try to force the key to turn - jamming the key inside and causing considerable damage. If you had taken a step back and thought rationally, you would have realized that if the key is having difficulty turning then you must have stuck in the wrong key! When someone gets angry he turns off his intellect and acts on his instincts. He doesn't think rationally any more. Anger and intellect are a contradiction to each other./\r\n\r\nThe fact that the laws were not transmitted through Moshe was not a punishment. Rather, when Moshe became angry his instincts took over and his wisdom was removed from him. He could not remember the laws and so they had to be transmitted through Elazar./\r\n\r\nAnger can destroy years of investment in a relationship in a matter of minutes. It destroys one's health, eats away at happiness, and causes a person to lose his ability to think clearly. The trick is to hold yourself back at that initial instinctive reaction to retaliate; bite your tongue for just a few moments and then the anger will subside, enabling you to act rationally."},{ID:47,parshaId:42,vort:"For the Children of Israel and the proselyte and resident among them shall these six cities be a refuge, for anyone who kills a person unintentionally to flee there. (Num. 35:15)/\r\n\r\nWhen someone takes a life unintentionally but with some degree of carelessness, the perpetrator is exiled to a city of refuge. He remains there until the death of the Kohen Gadol, the High Priest. Once the Kohen Gadol dies he is permitted to leave./\r\n\r\nThe Mishnah states that the mother of each Kohen Gadol used to hand out food to the murderers confined in the cities of refuge, in the hope of preventing them from praying for her son's speedy death. The question is: why would God listen to the prayers of a murderer and kill the Kohen Gadol - one of the leaders of the generation?!/\r\n\r\nThe power of prayer is not necessarily dependent on who you are but rather on your appreciation of who God is and your realization of Divine Providence. There is no one who has greater clarity in this than the man who killed unintentionally. He walks into the forest planning to chop wood and not intending to hurt anyone. He swings his axe. The axe head flies off the handle and kills an innocent bystander. He sees clearly how God has life and death completely in His hands. When he prays with such clarity in the knowledge that God is in control of everything, his prayer carries such an enormous weight that even the Kohen Gadol could die!/\r\n\r\nThe Maharsha writes that when a person prays sincerely, any benefit derived from prayer, no matter how extraordinary it appears, can be considered natural, since prayer has been an innate part of existence since the time of creation.

He told them that even if they had seen a similar case two or three times in the past, they should still deliberate before issuing a ruling. The first mishnah in Pirkei Avos begins with this precaution: "Be deliberate in judgment." Pirkei Avos teaches lessons for daily living. It consists of morals and ethics that the Sages wished to impart to their students. Why did they choose to begin with a lesson for judges, something that appears not to apply to everyone?/\r\n\r\nEvery driving manual opens with a caution to the driver to be aware that while driving he is constantly making decisions. He is constantly thinking, "Should I brake now? Should I go through the yellow light? Do I have enough time to make this turn?" If these choices are made in haste the results can be tragic./\r\n\r\nDaily living involves constant judgment and decision-making. When we meet people we immediately size them up. We are quick to judge people\'s actions. We make personal decisions. We decide where to live, how to lead life\u2026 The mishnah is telling us, "Be deliberate in judgment." Every man is a judge.

(Deut. 5:18)/\r\n\r\nWe understand why God commanded us not to steal or to kill; after all, it is physically possible for a person to refrain from performing such crimes. On the other hand, jealousy is an emotion and is an integral part of human nature; when you see something you like - you desire it. How can the Torah forbid something so natural as to desire someone else's possessions?/\r\n\r\nThe Ibn Ezra uses a profound insight into human nature to explain this prohibition. It is quite expected that an ignorant, poverty-stricken peasant might covet his neighbor's daughter, but it would never dawn on him to lust after the queen. She is so far away and inaccessible that such a thought would never enter his mind. Sensible, logical people only yearn for things within their frame of reference; they have no interest in things that are beyond their scope or their imagination. Similarly, man must perceive his neighbor's belongings as unattainable, like a golden ingot in Fort Knox./\r\n\r\nA storekeeper once complained to R' Meir of Premishlan, \"Somebody opened a store right next to mine, and he is taking my business away!\" The sage replied, \"Have you ever seen a horse drink water from a river? He walks into the water and stamps his hooves. He sees another horse also drinking, he's envious and afraid that the 'other' horse will drink up all the water, and therefore he kicks his own mirror image. That is the attitude of the horse, but you know better. Realize that there is enough water in the river for all the horses, and no one can touch what God has prepared for you.

What is the reason for this change?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person finds himself in an inconvenient situation, he may become distressed and upset that such a "curse" has happened to him. For example, if one gets stuck in traffic he may miss his flight, and as a result he may lose out on a big business deal. But the truth is that it can actually turn out to be a blessing. It is possible that the loss of money is meant as an atonement for past sins, as well as preventing worse catastrophes from occuring. The Torah is alluding to this message by putting "See" in the singular form, for there is really only "One" that knows if something is a blessing or a curse - God./\r\n\r\nA man once asked King Solomon to teach him the language of the birds. King Solomon refused, explaining that it was not a good idea to be familiar with it. The man persisted, so King Solomon taught it to him./\r\n\r\nOne day the man was walking down the street and listened to the birds chirping. They were talking about him, saying that tonight all his sheep were going to die! He thought to himself, "This is horrible news, but at least I can sell them before that happens." Indeed he sold his sheep./\r\n\r\nA few days later he listened to the birds chirping, and again they were talking about him, saying his house was going to burn down. He quickly sold it, thinking to himself, "It\'s a good thing that I know bird language! I am saving myself so much money!"/\r\n\r\nThe next day he heard the birds saying that tonight he would die! He ran to King Solomon and told him what had happened. King Solomon replied, "Now you\'ll understand why I didn\'t want you to know the language of the birds. You did a certain sin for which you deserved a severe punishment, but God, in His great kindness, wanted to give you a clean slate by giving you a small punishment - killing all your sheep. However, you didn\'t allow Him to do that, so He moved on to your house. You still did not allow Him do so, and therefore the only thing that God could give you to provide you with atonement was your death."/\r\n\r\nWhen troubles befall a person he should attempt to accept it with joy, for who knows what tragedies it is saving him from.'},{ID:52,parshaId:47,vort:'Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue. (Deut. 16:20)/\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the parsha the Torah tells us, "Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue." The second "righteousness" seems superfluous. What is it coming to teaching us?/\r\n\r\nSometimes a person wants to do God\'s will but he gets so caught up in fulfilling the commandments that he overlooks different areas. For example, he might want to rise very early in the morning to pray, but his alarm then awakens everyone else in his family./\r\n\r\nReb Bunim of Peshis\'cha interprets the verse in this vein: pursue righteousness righteously. It is not enough to seek righteousness; it must be done through honest means. The Torah does not condone the pursuit of holiness through improper means. One has to make sure that he is not stepping on anyone else\'s toes when performing the commandments./\r\n\r\nThe Chozeh of Lublin wanted to arise very early one morning to take care of a great mitzvah. The night before he asked his wife to prepare supper extra early so that he would be able to wake up in time. That night, not only was supper not served early - it was served even later than usual. Consequently he did not wake up in time and did not perform that great mitzvah. He thought to himself, "I would be justified in getting angry at my wife. However, why should I get angry because my wife prevented me from serving God? It\'s God\'s will for me not to get angry!"'},{ID:53,parshaId:48,vort:'If a man will have a wayward and rebellious son... (Deut. 21:18)/\r\n\r\nThe "Rebellious son" is one who repeatedly steals money to purchase meat and wine and consumes it in a disgusting manner. He is brought to Bais Din, the Jewish Court and is subject to capital punishment. According to one opinion in the Gemara the case of the "rebellious son" never happened and never will happen, since in practice the detailed requirements derived from the verses are never fulfilled. If so, why did God find it necessary to place this portion in the Torah?/\r\n\r\nThe death penalty imposed on the rebellious son is not because of the gravity of his sins, but because his behavior demonstrates that he will degenerate into a monstrous human being for whom there is no hope. The Torah is teaching us that a person for whom there is no hope will never exist. If you were created, and you exist, then you can become great!/\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we may fall and convince ourselves that we are failures. If we try something a few times and it doesn\'t go, we then believe that we can\'t be successful. But the truth is the exact opposite. King Solomon wrote, "A righteous person falls seven times, yet rises again." (Mishlei 24:16) The uninformed assume the meaning to be that greatness can be achieved despite experiencing an occasional stumble; however, the wise know that the verse\'s intention is to instruct us that the very path to greatness is solely attained by stumbling and then rising. Stumbling is not a sign of failure but rather an opportunity for greatness. Each time you fall know that you\'re one step closer to becoming great!/\r\n\r\nThomas Edison, considered the greatest inventor of his time, was responsible for over 1,000 different patents, and some refinements of previous inventions. Edison failed to refine the light bulb (one of the few things he merely refined but did not invent) so many times that it took him 10,000 attempts to perfect it! However, rather than accepting failure 9,999 times he is quoted as saying, "I have not failed. I have just found 9,999 ways that do not work." In his mind failure was simply another stepping stone on the road to success.'},{ID:54,parshaId:49,vort:"And you shall take of the first of every fruit of the ground... (Deut. 26:2)/\r\n\r\nThe Parsha begins with the commandment of Bikkurim, the first fruits. The farmer is to take his first ripened fruits to the temple and present them to the Cohen. The Midrash teaches that it was in the merit of the bringing of the first fruits that the world was created. What is so significant about this mitzvah?/\r\n\r\nMan was placed in the world with the mission of recognizing his Creator. The problem is that we are consumed with manipulating and changing the world. We're busy conquering space, closing deals, creating products, erecting buildings and traveling the information super-highway. It comes to a point that we begin thinking not only that we are God-like in that we have a creative force in the world, but that we are actually God, complete masters of the universe./\r\n\r\nThe purpose of bikkurim is to make sure we don't misunderstand our place in the universe. A person spends many months plowing, planting and caring for his field. After much hard work and sweat the first fruits are beginning to ripen! He's excited to taste the fruits which he himself nurtured and developed. Yet, recognizing that the whole process was really God's doing, he takes those very first ripe fruits and brings it to the Temple. Man merely goes through the motions, but God actually creates./\r\n\r\nOnce we recognize that we're not the Creator and everything we have is a gift from God only then do we have the ability to form a relationship with Him."},{ID:55,parshaId:50,vort:'And you shall choose life, so that you will live, you and your offspring. (Deut. 30:19)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah stresses that choosing life is not only for the benefit of the one making the choice, but also for the benefit of his offspring so that they will live. How does your decision to want life help your children? Don\'t they have to choose life as well?/\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a person to learn Torah and do mitzvos, and yet these actions won\'t have any positive effect on his children. If one does mitzvot because he believes in God and knows that he has to do it, but does so half-heartedly, or with the attitude that they are a heavy burden, his children may well choose not to follow his path of Torah and mitzvot. For example, after spending $100 on an etrog he says, "Oiy, s\' iz shver tzoo zaiyn a yid" (it is hard to be a Jew). Naturally, his children will be reluctant to follow the Torah. They\'ll reason, "Our father is doing all this because he has to. We are not as strong as him and it is just too hard for us to keep the Torah."/\r\n\r\nHowever, if one does mitzvot with joy and pride, making it clear that this is what gives him life and energizes him, then they will want to experience the same enjoyment in life that their father experienced. Therefore the Torah tells us, "You shall choose life in a way that will inspire your children to choose it and live."'},{ID:56,parshaId:51,vort:"So now, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel\u2026 (31:19)/\r\n\r\nOur Sages derive from this verse that each person is required to write a Sefer Torah, a Torah scroll for himself. Even if one inherited a Sefer Torah or received one as a gift, he is nevertheless still obligated to write one. Why is it so important for each individual to write his own Sefer Torah?/\r\n\r\nA person who starts a business will put his whole heart and soul into it. He will stay up late at night and spend lots of money to make sure everything runs smoothly. If anyone makes a negative remark about his company, he will be the first one to stick up for it. For some reason he never gets sick and doesn\u2019t need to take off. When he retires and passes the reigns over to his son, things just won\u2019t be the same. His son will definitely do his job and may even work overtime, but he won\u2019t put his whole heart and soul into it like his father did. After all, it\u2019s not his own business. There is no comparison between an employee and the founder of a company./\r\n\r\nA person is obligated to write his own Sefer Torah because Hashem wants a person to feel the Torah is his own, and not a hand-me-down. Each individual is meant to become a CEO over the Torah, going to great lengths to make sure he fulfills the Torah, and spending the time and effort to ensure that his \u201cbusiness\u201d is running smoothly."},{ID:57,parshaId:52,vort:"The Rock! \u2013 perfect is His work, for all His paths are justice; a God of faith without iniquity, righteous and fair is He. (32:4)/\r\n\r\nFew people need to be convinced that God created the world. However, situations may occur that are difficult to comprehend and leave even believers with many questions. There is a higher level of belief in God: not only did He create the world, but He is intimately involved in its day-to-day running. Hashem presses all the buttons and causes all events to occur, right down to the last detail./\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that the Torah put the first commandment in the context of the exodus: \u201cI am your God who has taken you out of the land of Egypt.\u201d Even though it would have been logical for God to identify himself as the Creator of the universe, a more all-inclusive title than that of engineer of the exodus, God was teaching us that He is also deeply involved in our everyday lives, intervening to pluck us out of Egypt./\r\n\r\nA guest in a village did not understand why the more important members of the shul sat at the back, while the beggars and paupers sat at the front. When he questioned the shul president about it he was told, \u201cYou are confused because you are here for only one Shabbos. If you would be here every Shabbos you would understand that we have a procedure of alternating places which, over the course of a year, is fair to everybody.\u201d The Chofetz Chaim uses this parable to demonstrate that our questions and doubts over God\u2019s supervision of the world are due to our lack of understanding. God\u2019s management of this world is based on considerations of a 6,000 year time period. We are in this world for a sum total of 70, 80, or maybe 90 years. How can we expect to know the answers when we are missing parts of the puzzle?"},{ID:58,parshaId:53,vort:"May this blessing rest upon Yoseph\u2019s head, and upon the crown of him who was separated from his brothers.

The opening three words end in the letters taf, aleph, mem, which spell emet \u2013 truth, and the closing three words end in aleph, mem, taf, which again spell emet. Rabbi Simchah Bunim of P'shis'che cites the Talmudic statement, \u201cThe seal of God is emet\u201d, and comments, \u201cIt is customary for an author to place his name in the opening of his book. God placed His Name emet \u2013 truth, in the opening chapter of the Torah. Emet thus envelops all of creation, a testimony to God as the Creator.\u201d\r\n\r\nDivrei Shaul notes that all traits can be a matter of degree. There can be greater beauty and lesser beauty, greater wisdom and lesser wisdom, greater strength and lesser strength, etc. Only one trait cannot be more or less: truth. There is no such thing as greater truth and lesser truth. Something is either true or is not true.\r\n\r\nGod is identified with truth. Just as truth can never be altered, because altered truth is no longer true, there can be no change in God. (Malachi,2:6).\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that emet is broad-based, consisting of the first letter of the alphabet, aleph, the middle letter, mem, and the last letter, taf (Shabbos 55a). Truth, therefore, has stability and durability. Falsehood, on the other hand, is the Hebrew sheker, consisting of three letters near the end of the alphabet. Sheker is top-heavy and cannot endure.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that a person lives with truth is the extent one identifies with God. Any falsehood distances a person from God."},{ID:2,parshaId:1,vort:"While perhaps our motivation for being giving people should be because it is a religious imperative or because it is just the right thing to do, there is an added benefit as it seems to lead to increased mental health and life expectancy. Some studies link being a caregiver, whether for a family member or for others, with living longer. Others indicate that people who consistently volunteer outlive those that don\u2019t. There are even studies that link owning and taking care of pets with a longer life span.\r\n\r\nWhen Noah is commanded to gather the animals there are two seemingly contradictory instructions. On the one hand, he is told that he should bring the animals to the ark (\u201ctavi el hateiva \u2013 you shall bring to the ark\u201d), and on the other, he is told that the animals will come to him (\u201cyavo-u eilecha \u2013 shall come to you\u201d) (6:19-20).\r\n\r\nRabbeinu Bechaye clarifies that the intent is that Noah will not have to go and seek out the animals from their natural habitats as the animals will all approach Noah. Once they arrived near the ark, Noah was tasked to bring them inside. Yet, we are left wondering, if God would provide a miracle that ensured that the animals all came to Noah, why make him responsible for bringing them into the ark? Why not just finish the miracle and have the animals board the ark on their own?\r\n\r\nRabbi Moshe Alshich provides a powerful explanation. If viewed from a perspective of strict judgment (\u201cdin\u201d), Noah did not merit being saved either. The only way he would survive is if God dealt with him with mercy (\u201crachamim\u201d). Yet, in order to earn God\u2019s mercy, Noah needed to demonstrate his own acts of mercy. He needed to commit acts of kindness and generosity in order to warrant being saved. God could have just brought the animals into the ark, but it was imperative that Noah be afforded the opportunity to interact with the animals and demonstrate his ability to be compassionate. Therefore, the animals were just brought to Noah, but he needed to physically escort them into the ark.\r\n\r\nThe stated purpose in the sentences of this whole enterprise is in order \u201clehachyot\u201d \u2013 to make live. The verb is intransitive, meaning that it does not explicitly state who is made to live through Noah\u2019s actions. Radak explains that it is referring to the animals. Noah was responsible for the physical health of the animals and needed to provide food for them daily in order that they live. Alshich, building off his thesis that Noah needed to exhibit his ability to act mercifully in order to survive, explains that \u201clehachyot \u2013 to make live\u201d can also be referring to Noah. By becoming the caretaker of the animals, Noah himself would be granted a longer life.\r\n\r\nIn a world flooded with verbal violence and hostility, we would do well to learn a lesson from Noah. Let us act with compassion, mercy, and generosity to all beings. By doing so, may we merit God\u2019s mercy and be granted long, happy, and healthy lives."},{ID:3,parshaId:2,vort:"And he trusted in God, and God reckoned (it to him as righteousness 15:6)\r\n\r\nThe Torah tells us that God considered the patriarch Abraham\u2019s faith to be meritorious. But let us reflect a moment. If God spoke to any of us, would we not have an unshakeable faith? In what way is Abraham praiseworthy for believing in God with Whom he communicated directly?\r\n\r\nThis question is also asked about Moses. How could Moses fulfill the mitzvah of having faith in God when he was in direct contact with him? We do not have faith that there is a moon or that two plus two equals four. That which we see or understand does not require an act of faith.\r\n\r\nThe answer was given by Rabbi Mordechai of Lechovitz, who cited the Talmud that at the end of a person\u2019s life when he stands before God, he will be asked, \u201cDid you transact in faith?\u201d (Shabbos 31a). This is usually understood as asking whether one transacted business honestly. Rabbi Mordechai said that it has an additional meaning. When a person transacts in business, he negotiates and tries in every way to maximize his profit. He does not settle for a meager gain. his is what one will be asked at the end of his life: \u201cDid you transact in faith?\u201d i.e., did you do everything possible to maximize your faith, or did you just accept whatever you were given?\r\n\r\nAbraham and Moses transacted in faith. They, of course, knew there was a God. They did not have to have faith in His existence. But they tried to strengthen their faith by coming to an ever greater knowledge of God and believing even that which they could not see about God.\r\n\r\nSome people take their faith in God for granted. Of course, they believe that there is a God. But they may not have gone beyond that to try to know more and more about God. We have great works available to us to increase our faith and broaden our concept of God. If we fail to do so, we will have no answer when we are asked, \u201cDid you seek to improve the quality of your faith? Did you transact in faith?\u201d"},{ID:4,parshaId:3,vort:"He (Lot) said, \u201cBehold now, my lords; turn about please, to your servant\u2019s house; spend the night and wash your feet, then wake up early and go your way\u2026\u201d He made a feast for them and baked matzos, and they ate (19:2-3).\r\n\r\nMany books have been written about parenting. There is universal agreement that the single greatest influence on children is their parents\u2019 behavior. All other techniques parents may employ are not nearly as effective as what they themselves do. Parental behavior is deeply ingrained in children.\r\n\r\nThe Torah teaches us this in the character of Lot. Lot was a rogue who rejected Abraham, saying, \u201cI want neither Abram nor his God\u201d (Rashi, Genesis 13:11). Lot chose to live in the corrupt city of Sodom, fully aware of their decadence (ibid 13:13). He married a woman of Sodom, who turned into a pillar of salt as punishment because when Lot asked her to give his guests salt, she said, \u201dAre you trying to bring this wicked trait of hospitality to us?\u201d (Midrash). According to the Midrash, giving food and shelter to wayfarers was punishable by death in Sodom.\r\n\r\nYet this depraved scoundrel, Lot, risked his life to take in guests and indeed aroused the entire populace against him. He put himself in even greater danger when he defied the populace and sought to protect his guests. This seems to be incongruous with his degenerate character.\r\n\r\nR\u2019 Meir Rubman (Zichron Meir) says that having been exposed to his Uncle Abraham in his youth and having witnessed the overwhelming dedication which Abraham had to hachnasas orchim, welcoming guests, made an indelible impression on Lot. There is every reason to believe that Lot assimilated to his environment, and indeed, he was spared from the destruction of Sodom solely because he was Abraham\u2019s nephew (Rashi, Genesis 19:17). In spite of his depravity, he could not extirpate this particular trait, to the point of risking his life to be hospitable to guests.\r\n\r\nThis is a convincing example of the power of early imprinting. It is commonplace that children who were victims of parental abuse may swear that they will never be harsh to their children, yet they often repeat the very abuse they despised. This may seem to defy logic. However, the early imprinting of behavior may overwhelm logic. There is only one effective method to teach children proper behavior, and that is for parents to practice it themselves."},{ID:5,parshaId:4,vort:"I have given you the field, and as for the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; in the view of the children of my people have I given it to you. (Gen. 23:11,15)\r\n\r\nAvraham set out to buy the Cave of Machpela and the field surrounding it from Efron Hachiti. Efron said to Avraham \"Don't bother paying for it. I'll give you both the field and the cave as a gift!\" Shortly after, Efron changed his mind and set the price at 400 silver shekels. What happened?! Why did he suddenly change from being overly generous to being a greedy man?\r\n\r\nMany years ago the Rambam had a debate with philosophers. The philosophers claimed that a cat's nature could be altered to be like that of a human being. The Rambam said, \"An animal will always remain an animal.\" The philosophers went about proving their theory. They took a cat and spent weeks training it, and were finally ready to present their case. Everyone gathered to see what would happen. In walked a cat dressed as a waiter, carrying a tray with wine and glasses. Everyone was amazed. The Rambam, on the other side of the room, took a bag out of his pocket, opened it, and a mouse came out. The cat saw it, dropped the tray, and dashed across the room to catch the mouse! Everyone then agreed with the Rambam; you can definitely train a cat, but you can't change a cat's nature.\r\n\r\nEfron was the same. When Avraham asked him for the cave, they were in front of all the B'nei Cheis. Therefore Efron said that it was free, thinking, \"Why not let everyone think that I am a nice guy?\" When Avraham wanted to pay for it and was holding a wad of bills, Efron saw the money and forgot about everything he had said. He just wanted the cash, so he charged Avraham an enormous amount.\r\n\r\nSome people appear very pleasant and friendly, but if someone steps on their toe or spills something on them they go berserk. These people never truly changed their nature. When things are calm and going their way they are able to act nicely, but inside they are capable of exploding at the slightest infraction. By contrast, a person who truly changes his nature - through self-introspection, examination, and work - will be in total control of his attitude in every single situation. He won't be affected by external circumstances."},{ID:6,parshaId:5,vort:"Murray Bowen was one of the pioneers of the field of family therapy. He noted that families have a system of psychological interconnectedness. For instance, when one member of a family becomes anxious, this tends to have an emotional snowball effect on the other members of the family. For psychological health and wellness, it is important for individuals within families not to become too fused with the thoughts, emotions, and actions of other members of their family. Rather, the ideal is differentiation of the self, where each individual is able to experience and balance both intimacy with, and independence from, others in the family.\r\n\r\nAs Rabbi Jonathan Sacks highlighted in his essay, \u201cOn Clones and Identity,\u201d Yitzchak was the least individuated of the patriarchs. There isn\u2019t much we know about his life, but what we do know seems to parallel and repeat many of the events and actions of Avraham. They both have to leave their land and enter the land of the Plishtim because of a famine. They both tell Avimelech that their wives are their sisters. To accentuate the parallel, the Torah tells us that Yitzchak even re-digs the same exact wells that Avraham dug, and even gives them the same exact names that his father gave them! There seems to be a lack of differentiation of self on Yitzchak\u2019s part.\r\n\r\nApparently, there was insufficient water from Avraham\u2019s wells that Yitzchak re-dug, so Yitzchak moved towards individuation and initiative by digging a new well. Yet, the Torah tells us that his first attempt was fraught with difficulty. The people of Gerar claimed that the water from the well belonged to them, which led to an argument. Consequently, Yitzchak named that well \u201cEsek\u201d (dispute) because of the fight that transpired. Yitzchak\u2019s second attempt to dig a well was just as unsuccessful. It also led to controversy with the people of Gerar, so he called it \u201cSitnah\u201d (hatred) because of the hatred and enmity it engendered. Finally, Yitzchak\u2019s third attempt to dig was successful as it was devoid of dispute. Yitzchak calls this well \u201cRechovot, (expanse)\u201d which connotes peace, freedom, and space. Yitzchak is able to create a location for himself by differentiating from the Plishtim as well as carving out his own personal place in his family narrative./\r\n\r\nWhat is unclear, however, is why the third attempt was successful, while the first two were not. The Chafetz Chaim suggests that the Torah is teaching us a lesson in grit and perseverance: if at first you don\u2019t succeed, try and try again. Rabbi Norman Lamm suggests another approach in the name of his uncle, Rabbi Joseph Baumol. If we pay careful attention, there is a fundamental textual difference between the first two diggings and the third. For the first two, the verses highlight that it was Yitzchak\u2019s servants who dug the wells. Yet, for the third well it says that Yitzchak \u2013 not his servants \u2013 dug the third well./\r\n\r\nWhile there is a place for delegation, there are actions in life that must be performed by the individual if they are to be successful. While Avraham served as an important role-model for Yitzchak, it was time for Yitzchak to begin to differentiate and forge his own path. This journey could not be proxied out to others. It was something Yitzchak needed to experience himself. He needed to dig the new well, not his servants. Once he took responsibility and acted on his own accord, he was able to merit the \u201cRechovot\u201d \u2013 the space to flourish and grow on his own."},{ID:7,parshaId:6,vort:"He (Jacob) said, \u201cLook, the day is still long; it is not yet time to bring the livestock in; water the flock and go on grazing\u201d (Genesis, 29:7)./\r\n\r\nJacob was rather harsh in reprimanding the shepherds. Wasn't it obvious that the stone covering the well was so massive that it required many men to move it? The Rabbi of Gur (Imrei Emes) said that Jacob was aware of this, but that he rebuked them for not trying to move it. But is it not possible that they had in fact tried but could not move it? Yes, but just because they failed once, why were they not trying again? But how did Jacob know that they had not tried repeatedly? Was his rebuke justified?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch sheds light on this episode by asking, why was it necessary to cover the well with so massive a stone? Could they not have covered it with something not quite as heavy? He answers that the shepherds were suspicious of one another, and feared that a lighter cover would enable one of them to uncover the well on his own and take an unfair share of the water for his flock. In order to prevent this, they made it impossible to have access to the water unless they were all present.\r\n\r\nJacob understood this, and reasoned that people who had no trust in one another were likely to be indolent and not exert themselves. Traits are infectious. Trust and diligence are likely to go hand in hand, as are distrust and sloth. Jacob knew that they had not even tried to uncover the well./\r\n\r\nEven in a competitive world, we should have faith that what God decreed for us to have cannot be taken from us. Begrudging other people's success because we may think that it comes at our expense is a contemptible character trait, and unless we rid ourselves of this trait, it may affect other aspects of our character./\r\n\r\nCharacter traits are not likely to exist in isolation. True faith in God and to fargin others (be happy for someone else's good fortune) tend to go together./\r\n\r\nSo Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him a few days because of his love for her (29:20)/\r\n\r\nSome of the commentaries note that this appears to be the reverse of what we usually experience. Being separated from someone one loves makes each day of separation feel like an eternity. How could it be that Jacob's love for Rachel made seven years seem like but a few days?/\r\n\r\nI am indebted to one of my patients for an insight into this verse. This young man was recovering from an addiction to alcohol. He had become dependent on alcohol, and the thought that he could never drink again was intolerable. When he joined the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, he was told not to focus on the rest of his life, but to deal with just this day. \u201cIt is not impossible for you to abstain from drinking just today, is it? Then focus only on what you must do today. There is nothing you can do today about tomorrow's sobriety, so there is no point in contemplating it.\u201d/\r\n\r\nI have found this principle in the works of mussar. The yetzer hara (evil inclination) says, \u201cWhat point is there in trying to observe all the Torah prohibitions? There is no way you can do so for the rest of your life. You are certain to violate Torah in quest of your desires. Why fight a losing battle? Why struggle and deny yourself so many pleasures when you are doomed to fail at it? You might as well just give in now.\u201d The response to the yetzer hara should be, \u201cI do not have to deal with the rest of my life today. I know that today I can withstand temptation, and that is all I am concerned with. When tomorrow comes, I'll deal with that challenge then.\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe literal translation of the verse above is not \u201cthey seemed to him a few days.\u201d The Hebrew word achadim means \u201csingle days.\u201d The delay of seven years would have been very difficult to manage. Jacob, therefore, did not think of seven years, but took each day as it came. He could tolerate the deprivation today, and that was all that was necessary./\r\n\r\nThis is an important lesson for us. It is commonplace for people to make \u201cNew Year's resolutions,\u201d and these are soon broken. The reason for this is that a year is too great a task to undertake. One should resolve, \u201cI will not lose my temper today,\u201d or \u201cI will not smoke today\u201d or \u201cI will adhere to my diet today.\u201d Reducing challenges to smaller segments of time makes them much more manageable."},{ID:8,parshaId:7,vort:"Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn (32:25)/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that the person who attacked Jacob was the guardian angel of Esau. The commentaries add that this angel represents the yetzer hara, the prime spiritual force of evil that wished to vanquish Jacob and his descendants./\r\n\r\nThe rabbi of Slonim interprets this verse to provide us with an important lesson. He points out that the Hebrew word vayivoser \u2013 was left \u2013 can also mean \u201cto be superfluous,\u201d and the message of the verse is that Jacob felt that he was superfluous when he was alone, isolated and detached from others.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist says, \u201cFor I have said that the world is built upon chesed (loving-kindness).\u201d The Chassidic writings interpret this verse as a reason for Creation. Although we cannot have any concept into the essence of the Divine attributes, we are told that God created the world because \u201cit is in the nature of the good to do good\u201d and without a world, there would be no recipients for God's goodness./\r\n\r\nWe are supposed to emulate the Divine attributes, and the foremost obligation of man is to do chesed. But chesed cannot be done in a vacuum. The phrase, \u201cGod said `It is not good that man be alone,'\u2005\u201d (Genesis 2:18) means not only that a person should not be without a spouse, but also that \u201cthere can be no goodness when man is alone.\u201d Goodness requires that there be a relationship, a recipient of one's chesed. Inasmuch as the purpose of creation was for man to emulate God in doing chesed, failure or the inability to do chesed leaves a person unfulfilled./\r\nIn my writings on self-esteem (Angels Don't Leave Footprints) I pointed out that we value things for one of two reasons: (1) they are functional or (2) they are ornamental. If you have a grandfather clock whose mechanism breaks down, you may keep it as a handsome piece of furniture. If your can-opener no longer works, you discard it. Since it has no esthetic component, it has no value if it is not functional./\r\n\r\nOn what basis can a person have a sense of self-worth? Few people are so handsome as to be ornamental, and even those who are exceptionally handsome lose their beauty as they grow old. Man's true worth is in his function, and inasmuch as a major function of man is to do chesed, the inability or failure to do chesed deprives a person of a source of self-esteem.\r\n\r\nOne of the tactics of the yetzer hara is to crush a person by depriving him of the ability to do chesed. The person who is isolated from others and cannot give of himself to others may lose his sense of self-worth. My years of working with people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol has convinced me that one of the factors that lead to addiction is self-centeredness. One recovered alcoholic expressed it this way: \u201cI could look up at people or I could look down my nose at them. They were either far above me or beneath me, but I never felt that I belonged. Alcohol gave me the feeling that I belonged.\u201d This person escaped from the distress of isolation via the anesthetic effects of alcohol./\r\n\r\nFeeling that one does not belong causes a person to feel superfluous. The rabbi of Slonim found this message in the verse which he translated as, \u201cJacob felt superfluous because he was alone.\u201d The low self-esteem and depression incident to isolation renders a person vulnerable to the attack of the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nDoing chesed is not only a great mitzvah, but it also helps a person to have a sense of worthiness and self-esteem."},{ID:12,parshaId:8,vort:"When Yosef\u2019s brothers decide they are going to kill him and throw him into a pit, Reuven realizes that he needs to intervene to save Yosef\u2019s life. While Reuven\u2019s explicit intention is to return Yosef to Yaakov, he is caught in a predicament. What can he say or do that will convince the brothers not to kill Yosef? Their decision seems unanimous and definitive./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that if Reuven would have known that his decision would be recorded for history, he would have picked Yosef up on his shoulders and escorted him back to his father. But is this realistic? Would the brothers have allowed Reuven to just walk away with Yosef after they have condemned him to death?/\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Cialdini is known for his research on influence and persuasion. He spent three years as an \u201cundercover\u201d researcher training at used car dealerships, telemarketing firms, and fund-raising organizations in order to observe, analyze, and categorize principles of effective persuasion. If we analyze how Reuven influenced and persuaded his brothers in this crucial moment, we will uncover several strategies that Dr. Cialdini outlines in his research./\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his bestselling book \u201cInfluence: The Psychology of Persuasion,\u201d Dr. Cialdini writes that the first and foremost principle of persuasion is tapping into the other person\u2019s self-interest by convincing others that their decision will turn out best for them. It is so fundamental and obvious, he writes, that he doesn\u2019t even count it as one of his six principles of influence./\r\n\r\nThis, Rabbeinu Bechaye argues, is Reuven\u2019s strategy in convincing his brothers not to kill Yosef. He doesn\u2019t just say \u201clet\u2019s not hit him\u201d because that would leave open the possibility that Reuven was motivated by his own feelings of empathy and self-interest. Rather, he adds the word \u201cnefesh \u2013 soul,\u201d in order to emphasize that the goal is to avoid killing Yosef for the brothers\u2019 own sake: in order that they don\u2019t become murderers./\r\n\r\nAnother powerful category of influence is when the influencer convinces others that they are alike by identifying socially as a group with similar interests. Rabbi Yosef Bechor Shor identifies this strategy within Reuven\u2019s word-choice. Reuven doesn\u2019t speak at them saying \u201cdon\u2019t hit him,\u201d rather, he purposefully includes himself in the group with the intention of increasing his influence by saying, \u201clet us not hit him.\u201d Rabbeinu Bechaye suggests this strategy is also apparent in another strategic word-choice. Instead of saying \u201cdon\u2019t spill his blood,\u201d he just says, \u201cdon\u2019t spill blood.\u201d This subtle tactic indicates to the brothers that Reuven identifies with their hatred of Yosef and he is not concerned about Yosef\u2019s blood per se. Rather, the argument is not to spill any blood for the sake of not becoming murderers./\r\n\r\nDr. Cialdini writes that there is a single word that will dramatically boost the power of influence: because. In one study by Dr. Ellen Langer, when people making copies at a photocopy machine were asked by a stranger \u201cExcuse me, I have 5 pages, may I use the Xerox machine?\u201d 60 percent of the people complied. When the stranger added \u201cbecause I am in a rush,\u201d 94 percent complied. Even more fascinating, when the stranger just added the obvious explanation of \u201cbecause I have to make copies,\u201d there was still a 93 percent compliance rate. Just by adding a reason, influence is increased./\r\n\r\nAbarbanel sees this strategy in Reuven\u2019s argument as well. At first, all Reuven says is \u201clet\u2019s not kill him\u201d (37:21). Apparently, the brothers were not convinced yet, so Reuven adds in the next verse, \u201clet\u2019s not spill his blood, let\u2019s throw him into a pit\u201d (37:22). Abarbanel explains that after the brothers didn\u2019t respond to his general statement of \u201clet\u2019s not kill him, Reuven now provides the \u201cbecause.\u201d Let\u2019s not kill him because it is terrible to spill innocent blood directly./\r\n\r\nBy analyzing the verses in depth, we get a glimpse into the genius of Reuven\u2019s strategy to stop his brothers from committing murder. By using the subtle persuasion techniques of self-interest, group identification, and providing an explanation, he is able to diffuse a threatening situation and save Yosef\u2019s life."},{ID:13,parshaId:9,vort:"How much do you care about what other people think of you?/\r\n\r\nOn one level, it is natural and healthy to want the approval of others. If someone doesn\u2019t care at all what others think of him, he may do things that are harmful or immoral to others and end up being isolated from social groups, which itself is not healthy. Yet, the desire to be liked by others can easily become unhealthy. People who have a high need to gain approval from others determinedly seek admiration, sometimes at a high cost to their own goals. They tend to have higher anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem (that is contingent on how they think other people think of them)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud (Berachot 20a) relates that Yosef and his descendants are immune from the destructive power of the evil eye. Before we understand why they are immune, first we need to better understand this mysterious and controversial concept. Broadly speaking, as it is presented in the Talmud, when Person A looks upon Person B (or their material goods) with envy or jealousy, that act of looking can cause actual damage to Person B./\r\n\r\nThere have been several explanations of this concept throughout the ages, including (subsequently disproven) scientific explanations of the ability for the eye to emit a dangerous vapor or fire, and a theological proposal that the negative emotions provoke God to be extra meticulous towards Person B (which has its own set of controversial ramifications). Those who view the evil eye as a supernatural phenomenon either try not to draw too much attention to themselves or use various mystical procedures to try and counteract it./\r\n\r\nOthers, however, provide a more rationalist, psychological explanation of the concept. Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak HaKohen Kook, for instance, understands the evil eye as general social influence. We can be easily swayed by other people\u2019s beliefs, opinions and practices, and ayin hara (evil eye) is the term used to indicate being negatively impacted by others (see Ein Ayah on Berachot, p. 102). Someone who has self-confidence and is sure that they are doing what is right in the eyes of God won\u2019t be swayed by the negative influence of others, and is therefore immune to the evil eye./\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik assumes that ayin hara is representative of the negative social dynamics between two people. When Person A disagrees, criticizes, or opposes Person B, Person A is putting an ayin hara on Person B. If Person B\u2019s sense of self is too intertwined with what other people think of him, then when Person A does anything to indicate that he doesn\u2019t approve of Person B, Person B will be devastated. However, if Person B has a developed sense of self that is independent and does not desperately need the approval of others, then he would be immune to the ayin hara of others./\r\n\r\nTaking a similar rational approach, Rabbi Immanuel Bernstein argues that the reason Yosef was immune to the evil eye was because he was self-confident and not swayed by the opinions or negative influences of others. For instance, he told his brothers about his dreams even though it would lead them to not liking him. He resists the solicitation from the wife of Potifar because it was morally and spiritually wrong. Additionally, when Pharaoh tells Yosef that he has heard that he can interpret dreams, Yosef brazenly corrects Pharaoh\u2019s mistake in public, saying that it is God Who interprets the dreams. The running theme is that Yosef will say and do what he is sure God wants him to do, despite social pressure to do the opposite. This is what it means to be above the ayin hara./\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, we can all be immune to the evil eye. When others try to use peer pressure to sway us from doing what is right in the eyes of God, we can stay firm and strong, and confidently resist the strong pull to seek their approval."},{ID:14,parshaId:10,vort:'Jacob\'s life was shortened as a result of his complaint./\r\n\r\nThe powerful book "Chassidic Tales of the Holocaust" tells the story of a mother and her daughter, Livia, who somehow managed to survive the war. Looking out for each other, encouraging each other day after horror-filled day, they made it through the terror of several concentration camps./\r\n\r\nAfter the war, a sympathetic German woman looked at Livia and commented, "It must have been very difficult for people your age to endure all this suffering."/\r\n\r\n"How old do you think I am?" Livia asked her./\r\n\r\n"Maybe 60 or 62," replied the woman./\r\n\r\n"No. I\'m 14," replied Livia./\r\n\r\nTerrified upon hearing this, the women crossed herself and fled./\r\n\r\nThe enormous effect that sorrow can have upon a person\'s visage figures prominently in this week\'s Torah portion, Vayigash. In the narrative, the aged patriarch Jacob is brought before Pharaoh and gives him a blessing. Pharaoh then asks Jacob how old he is. Jacob responds: "Few and bad have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the years of the life of my forefathers in the days of their wanderings."/\r\n\r\nThe commentaries note that in fact Jacob did have a miserable life. For decades, he lived in fear that his brother Esav would murder him. Then he spent 20 years working for his wicked uncle Lavan, who constantly cheated him and made him work under the most difficult physical conditions. Then Dina, Jacob\'s only daughter, was tragically raped. Later, Jacob spent many years in sorrow, convinced that his beloved son Joseph had died./\r\n\r\nBut, despite going through all this pain (and perhaps in part because of it), Jacob managed to become a great tzaddik. In fact, he worked so hard on improving his character, that many classical sources describe Jacob as "the most righteous person who ever lived."/\r\n\r\nGiven that he had reached such a high level of righteousness, Jacob\'s comment to Pharaoh about his "life of great difficulty" seems inappropriate. While the average person may complain about life\'s trials, a tzaddik is not supposed to!/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash goes on to describe God\'s consternation with Jacob\'s comment. The Almighty tells Jacob: "I provided you with a refuge from Esav and Lavan, returned to you both Dina and Joseph - and you\'re complaining?!"/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash concludes that Jacob\'s life was shortened as a result of these words of complaint. For if Jacob (or anybody else) does not fully appreciate life, then why should he be granted longevity?!/\r\n\r\nOther commentaries, however, explain the incident with Pharaoh differently. They say that Pharaoh was overwhelmed by the ancient-looking appearance of Jacob, and asked about his age. Jacob, realizing that his appearance made him seem far older than he actually was, felt compelled to explain to Pharaoh the cause of this phenomenon, and described the difficulties he had faced in his life./\r\n\r\nThus, in the view of these commentaries, Jacob\'s words were not a complaint, but rather an explanation of his appearance. As a great tzaddik, he would not (especially to a public personage such as Pharaoh) utter bitter complaints about his life. Rather, Jacob was explaining how the tragedies of life had become etched on his visage ... just as they would on his great-granddaughter, Livia, some millennia hence.'},{ID:15,parshaId:11,vort:"There is no one \u201cright\u201d way to respond to a traumatic event and most people deal with trauma in slightly different ways. Yet, there is research that indicates that certain environments, perspectives and behaviors lead to more adaptive responses that create the opportunity for healing. Yosef, a survivor of several traumatic events, serves as a paradigm of resilience. By analyzing Yosef\u2019s mindset and behavior as presented in the verses and midrashim at the end of the Book of Genesis, we can identify several strategies that serve as protective factors for healthy resolutions of traumatic events./\r\n\r\nThe natural response to trauma is to try and avoid the painfulness of the experience. Yet, research indicates that the more one tries to avoid either by trying to not think about the traumatic event or by distancing oneself from anything that reminds one of the event, the greater likelihood one has of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)./\r\n\r\nConsequently, besides for being able to talk about the painful experience, one of the strategies in trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is to revisit the site of the trauma. One of the reasons why this is helpful is because it helps the person develop a \u201cthen versus now\u201d perspective, allowing the event to feel more in the past, rather than something that is continuing to be experienced in the present./\r\n\r\nThere is a fascinating group of midrashim that suggest that on the way back from burying Yaakov, Yosef took a detour to revisit the scene of his original trauma \u2013 the infamous pit where his brothers left him to die. Standing over the pit, gazing into the abyss, he confronts the site of the trauma. At that moment, he recites a blessing: \u201cBlessed is God (\u2018HaMakom\u2019) Who performed a miracle for me in this place (\u2018bamakom hazeh\u2019). This blessing reflects and reveals two important mindsets. First, as is indicated by the past grammatical tense, the blessing presupposes a break from the past. By being able to acknowledge being saved in the past, Yosef solidifies a \u201cthen versus now\u201d perspective./\r\n\r\nThe blessing also demonstrates a second important protective factor for Yosef \u2013 the ability to find positive meaning in the trauma. Broadly speaking, the blessing serves to spiritualize and sanctify the experience. More specifically, hinted at within the wording of the blessing is a powerful message. The word used to connote God in the blessing is \u201cHaMakom,\u201d literally, \u201cThe Place\u201d - \u201cBlessed is The Place, Who performed a miracle for me at this place.\u201d Embedded within the wording, Yosef is acknowledging what he explicitly states within the Torah verses. The whole narrative, starting with the trauma that happened at this place, reflects the Will of The Place. Yosef acknowledges the positive meaning within the trauma: God orchestrated each element of the story for the survival of the descendants of Yaakov in Egypt./\r\n\r\nFinally, the story closes with Yosef demonstrating one more protective factor, namely, helping others in their healing process. Yosef\u2019s brothers were scared that Yosef would seek out retribution now that Yaakov died, and Yosef was in a position of power. Yosef doesn\u2019t just reassure them that he won\u2019t harm them and that he will provide sustenance for them, but he also \u201ccomforted them and spoke to their hearts\u201d (Bereishit 50:21). Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch suggests that Yosef was helping them with their healing process by trying to assuage their feelings of guilt by emphasizing the Divinely ordained elements of what transpired and the positive outcomes of everyone now having enough food to survive./\r\n\r\nWhile we hope to not experience traumatic events in the first place, if we are confronted with a trauma, we can learn a number of powerful strategies from Yosef, including; revisiting the scene in a safe context to foster a \u201cthen versus now\u201d perspective, finding meaning and positive benefit within the event, and helping others heal through their own healing process."},{ID:16,parshaId:12,vort:"\"A new king arose over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud quotes two opinions: It was either a new king or the existing monarch with new policies, who acted as if he \u201cdid not know of Joseph\u201d (Sotah 11a). The Midrash follows the second opinion, and states that when the Egyptians turned against the Jews, Pharaoh refused to go along with them and they deposed him for three months, until he yielded to their wishes (Shemos Rabbah 1:9)./\r\n\r\nIs it not amazing that the king who said to Joseph, \u201cSince God has informed you of all this, there can be no one so discerning and wise as you\u201d (Genesis 41:39), now says to Moses, \u201cWho is God that I should heed His voice to send out Israel? I do not know God\u201d (Exodus 5:2)?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Meir Rubman cites Mishnas R' Eliezer: \u201cThe reason the Torah is so harsh regarding an ingrate is because denial of gratitude toward another person is tantamount to denial of gratitude toward God. Today one denies gratitude toward a fellow man, and the next day he denies gratitude toward God. All of Egypt knew that Joseph had saved their land, as did Pharaoh. However, Pharaoh chose to deny gratitude toward Joseph, and thereafter denied God, saying, \u201cWho is God that I should heed His voice? #133; I do not know God\u201d (Lekach Tov, Shemos p. 5)/\r\n\r\nHow we relate to God depends on how we relate to other people. When the Baal Shem Tov was asked, How can one develop a love for God? How can one love a Being that one cannot see or have any sense experience of Him? He responded, \u201cLove your fellow man. This will lead you to love of God.\u201d Indeed, the Talmud says that the way a human being can cleave unto God is to emulate His traits: \u201cJust as He is merciful, you should be merciful\u201d (Shabbos 133a)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Yehudah Leib Chasman shares another insight with us. The Midrash says that Pharaoh initially resisted his people's demands that he enslave Jews, because he felt indebted to Joseph and to Jacob's blessing the land. However, when expedience required that he persecute the Jews in order to retain his throne, he became a cruel tyrant, enslaving them and ordering their children to be killed. This shows us that a person is capable of altering his emotions. A person may not say, \u201cThat's me. That's just the way I am.\u201d/\r\n\r\nPharaoh underwent an emotional change because of his desire to keep his position. Just as a person can alter one's emotions negatively, so can one change one's emotions positively. Pharaoh was motivated by expedience. A person can also be motivated by a sincere conviction to do what is right. One need only realize which emotions are proper and have a sincere desire to cultivate them./\r\n\r\nPeople who do not wish to put forth the effort to modify their character traits may say, \u201cI was born that way.\u201d Rabbi Shneur Zalman says in Tanya, \u201cIt is an inborn capacity that the intellect can be master over the emotions.\u201d The ability to change is an inborn trait. In fact, it is the most significant distinguishing feature between man and other living things. A person who denies his ability to alter his character is lowering himself to a subhuman level. Our dignity should not allow us to do this."},{ID:17,parshaId:13,vort:"One of the first and most central interventions to help manage difficult emotions is deep breathing. When we feel intense emotions, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, our bodies tend to react physiologically by taking shorter and shallower breaths. By counteracting those quick and narrow breaths with a deeper breath, we increase the supply of oxygen to our brains, stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, and signaling to our bodies that we can calm down./\r\n\r\nAs strange as this might sound, deep breathing often requires training and practice. Many people take deep breaths with their upper chest, which can actually increase breathing rate and cause hyperventilation. An effective deep breath is known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing because it is done by focusing the breath below the rib cage, with the stomach moving, rather than the chest./\r\n\r\nToward the end of last week's Torah portion, we are informed that after the Children of Israel saw the signs that Moshe performed and were informed that God took note of their hardships, they were convinced and believed in the redemption to come (Shemot 4:30-31). Yet, in the beginning of Parshat Vaeira when Moshe elaborates on the message of redemption, the Children of Israel do not listen \u201cmi-kotzer ruach u-mei-avodah kasha\u201d \u2013 \u201cfrom shortness of breath and from the hard work\u201d (Shemot 6:8). Many commentators understand these to be two distinct reasons for not listening (see Ohr HaChaim): it was difficult to pay attention because of all the physical labor (hard work), but there was an additional psychological component of being short of breath (shortness of breath) that contributed to the inability to listen. What was this psychological impediment?/\r\n\r\nIf we survey the commentators, we can identify three distinct emotions that may have inhibited their ability to listen. The Midrash (Pesikta Zutarta) suggests that the Children of Israel were angry and that led them to subvert their original correct approach which was to believe in the redemption. While the Midrash does not state explicitly what they were angry about, perhaps it was because they were promised redemption and then nothing subsequently changed./\r\n\r\nRabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk suggests that they couldn\u2019t process the message of hope because they were depressed. This is alluded to as well in the commentary of Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi who suggests that the Children of Israel were not psychologically prepared or receptive to messages of comfort because they were devoid of any hope. Rabbeinu Bechayei goes so far as to suggest that they were fed up with life and lost the will to live./\r\n\r\nA third group of commentators focus on fear and anxiety as hindering the message of hope. For instance, Ramban suggests that the Children of Israel were afraid that Pharaoh or the officers would kill them. Maharal adds that besides the actual physical difficulty of the labor, they were also worried about the fact that the work was so difficult./\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether one of the approaches is correct or if there is truth to all three, it is fascinating that they are all rooted in the term kotzer ruach, shortness of breath. The metaphor used to encapsulate emotional distress \u2013 whether anger, depression, or anxiety \u2013 is shortness of breath. Without critiquing our ancestors\u2019 reaction in Egypt, perhaps we can learn a message for our own lower-level \u201chard work \u2013 avoda kasha\u201d experiences. When we are confronted with difficulties and react with the shortness of breath of an unhealthy emotion, let us take a step back and take some deep breaths. If we can manage our anger, depression, or anxiety, perhaps we will have enough headspace to listen to the messages of hope and redemption."},{ID:18,parshaId:14,vort:"Sometimes a task seems too difficult, daunting, or incongruent with our personality that we elect to be passive.

Commentators struggle as to the meaning and depth behind this commandment. Some commentators suggest that not breaking the bones reflects a rushed mentality that was essential for leaving Egypt. People in a rush don\u2019t have time to break a bone and suck out the marrow. They quickly eat the meat and throw away the bone (see Rashbam and Bechor Shor)./\r\n\r\nOthers see a character flaw within the act of breaking the bones. It can be seen as gluttonous and excessive to break a bone to suck out the marrow, which reflects poorly on the eater, is degrading to the honor befitting of the sacrifice, and calls into question the validity of the sacrifice, which needs to be eaten when one is full./\r\n\r\nIt is within the context of this mitzvah that the Sefer HaChinuch presents his famous thesis that our personality is influenced by our actions (\u201cacharei ha-peulot nimshachim ha-levavot\u201d). Preempting his son\u2019s question as to why the Torah would provide so many laws related to the Exodus, the Sefer HaChinuch explains that the purpose of this mitzvah, and mitzvot in general, is to provide us with actions that inculcate character. By not breaking the bones we are demonstrating our break from slavery and our new existence of freedom. It is not proper, he argues, for people of stature to break bones while eating. Therefore, when exiting servitude, the Children of Israel are called upon to act like royalty, even if they don\u2019t feel like royalty. They \u2013 and by extension, we \u2013 are encouraged to not just fake it till we make it, but fake it till we become it."},{ID:19,parshaId:15,vort:"We are generally aware that what we eat impacts our overall health and eating unhealthily can put us at risk for the development of numerous physical diseases. Yet, there is also mounting research that what we eat also greatly affects our intellectual abilities and our emotional health. Our diets affect the neurotransmitters in our brains which can impact our cognitive functioning and our moods. Diets high in refined sugar impair our thinking abilities and tend to focus us on pursuing even more food with high sugar content. Cognitive decline has also been associated with diets high in cholesterol and saturated fats. In contrast, diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and unsaturated fats, like omega-3, are linked with increased cognitive and emotional health./\r\n\r\nWhen introducing the concept of the manna, God frames the miracle as a test for the Children of Israel to see if they will follow in his laws. The commentators differ in their understanding of the nature of this test and which laws are being tested. Rashi suggests that the test is whether they will follow the rules specific to the manna, which includes a restriction against leaving any leftover or for going out to collect it on Shabbat. Ramban disagrees and writes that the test is not whether they will follow the laws, but whether they will trust in God to follow Him through the wilderness, despite the lack of natural food sources. Chizkuni offers a third interpretation: since God is providing free food from the Heaven \u2013 which does not require a lot of preparation time before eating \u2013 the test is whether the Children of Israel will use their free time to study Torah./\r\n\r\nElaborating on this last theme, Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz suggests that the manna served to counteract each of three broad categories of impediments to learning Torah. One, is that we tend to spend lots of time in the pursuit of securing food for consumption. Since the Children of Israel were in the middle of the desert, they would have to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy just to find food, something they did not have to do now that they had the manna./\r\n\r\nA second impediment is that those who have lots of food (or money) tend to spend a lot of time busying themselves with protecting and growing their savings, which can detract from the amount of time learning. Therefore, there were strict limitations on the amount of manna one could gather, preventing anyone from amassing a distracting amount of food.\r\n\r\nA third impediment to proper Torah learning is the food itself. Writing in the seventeenth century, Rabbi Luntschitz observed that certain coarse and heavy foods diminished the clarity and effectiveness of people\u2019s thinking so that they could not focus properly on intellectual pursuits. The manna did not have any of these detrimental cognitive effects, ensuring the Children of Israel's ability to focus on learning Torah. The test, therefore, was whether they would use their free time for the pursuit of Torah if all of these impediments were removed./\r\n\r\nWhile we aren\u2019t blessed with the miracle of manna now, we would do well to try and incorporate some of the lessons into our own lives. This includes a broad reminder about following God\u2019s laws and trusting in Him to provide for us. But it also provides for us a moment to reflect on our eating habits and how they affect our general spiritual productivity. Do we spend more time than necessary buying, preparing, and eating various foods that are not necessarily essential to our well-being? Could we cut out some of that time and apply it to learning Torah and doing acts of kindness? Can we prioritize eating foods that help boost our cognitive abilities and stay away from ones that give us brain fog and make us feel sluggish?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps even without the manna we can do our best to replicate the benefits our ancestors were afforded with this powerful, yet challenging, miracle.\r\n\r\n"},{ID:20,parshaId:16,vort:"And they encamped in the Wilderness and Israel encamped there, opposite the mountain [Sinai] #(19:2)/\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the narration that precedes the giving of the Torah is more than just historical. It indicates the prerequisites of Torah./\r\n\r\nRashi points out that the Hebrew word for encamped is vayichan, he camped, rather than vayachanu, they camped. Furthermore, the Ten Commandments were also spoken in the singular, Anochi Hashem Elokecha, your God in the singular, rather than the plural elokeichem. The singular form of the verb is utilized because there was such complete unity among the Israelites that they were like one person, hence the entire nation could be addressed in the singular./\r\n\r\nThe Torah was given to each individual, and every person is required to fulfill the 613 mitzvot. It is obvious that technically this is impossible. There are some mitzvot whose performance is restricted to Kohanim (priests), which Yisrael cannot perform. A person whose firstborn child is a girl cannot fulfill the mitzvah of pidyon haben (redemption of the firstborn son). Mitzvot that apply to judges do not apply to lay people. How can any single person fulfill all 613 mitzvot?/\r\n\r\nTorah scholars have provided the answer. When a person puts on the tefillin (phylacteries) on his arm and head, it is not just the arm and head that have the mitzvah, but the whole person. Similarly, when people are united, they are as one, and a mitzvah performed by one person is shared by those with whom one is united./\r\n\r\nHow tragic that we have allowed ourselves to be divisive. Fragmentation not only weakens our nation, but deprives a person of acquiring the merit of those mitzvot which he is unable to perform./\r\n\r\nEvery human trait may have positive applications, even something as repulsive as selfishness. We should realize that eliminating the divisiveness that reigns among us is not merely altruistic. It is of inestimable personal benefit./\r\n\r\nIt is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of Rabbi Avraham Twerski, who passed away Sunday, Jan 31, 18 of Shevat. May his soul be bound in the bonds of life."},{ID:21,parshaId:17,vort:"Six days shall you accomplish your activities, and on the seventh day you shall desist, in order that your ox and donkey may rest #(23:12)/\r\n\r\nThere are some verses on which Rashi comments, \u201cthis verse demands an interpretation\u201d; i.e., it cannot be taken literally. The above verse is one that demands an interpretation./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that if a person observes Shabbos properly, it is as if he observed the entire Torah, whereas if one violates Shabbos, it is as if he violated the entire Torah (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 3). The Torah repeats the commandment of observing Shabbos several times, and it is one of the Ten Commandments. Yet, if we take the above verse literally, \u201cin order that your ox and donkey may rest,\u201d it would seem that the sole purpose of Shabbos is to provide respite for work animals. That can hardly be true. We must, therefore, look for another meaning in this verse, and the Torah commentaries provide it for us.\r\n\r\nThe mussar authorities say that the ox is the symbol of strength and energy, while the mule is a symbol of indolence and obstinacy. This is why, when the Torah wishes to tell us that a combined effort by two people or animals of opposite nature is prohibited, it states, \u201cYou shall not plow with an ox and a mule together\u201d (Deuteronomy 22:10; Chinuch, Mitzvah 550)./\r\n\r\nWe have a variety of character traits, in some of which we take pride, others we may wish to disown. The chassidic and mussar writings say that all human traits can be channeled into constructive channels. A person may wish to deny his feelings of aggression or obstinacy. There is no need to deny these. Rather, they should be directed toward constructive goals./\r\n\r\nIn psychology, there is the concept of sublimation. It is theorized that the subconscious mind can redirect an unacceptable drive toward proper goals. Thus, psychologists say, an astronomer who peers through a telescope or a scientist who looks through a microscope has converted a voyeuristic drive into a constructive curiosity. Although sublimation is certainly a beneficial mechanism, it is not accomplished consciously. The person has no awareness of the origin of his scientific curiosity./\r\n\r\nOur ethicists say that there is no need to deny or repress any urge or drive. These are part of our physiological makeup. Rather, we should allow ourselves to be aware of them and consciously redirect them. But this requires introspection and self-examination, something which most people have little time to do. We are too occupied with our daily activities to take time out for meditation, contemplation and soul-searching./\r\n\r\nShabbos provides the opportunity for introspection. \u201cSix days shall you accomplish your activities, and on the seventh day you shall desist.\u201d Desist and refrain from all your usual activities. Freeze your aggressive, assertive, indolent and obstinate traits. Let them not be manipulated by subconscious mechanisms. Allow them to be at rest, where you can examine them and see what you can do with them./\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a worthy function of Shabbos. It gives a person the opportunity to enhance one\u2019s spirituality by becoming the finest human being one can be."},{ID:22,parshaId:18,vort:'"The only thing I know, is that I know nothing.\u201d This idea, known as the Socratic Paradox, lays the groundwork for the perspective that knowledge is not something to be attained. In the modern psychology and educational literature this is expressed in the distinction between achievement and mastery orientations./\r\n\r\nPeople who have an achievement orientation want to demonstrate that they have accomplished and learned, while those with a mastery orientation want to develop their abilities, irrespective of actual attainment of a goal or an understanding of a particular piece of knowledge./\r\n\r\nThose that display a mastery orientation tend to do better academically, put in more effort, persist through challenges, and tend to love learning more than those with an achievement orientation./\r\n\r\nIn a striking passage, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv (Chochma U\u2019Mussar, p. 344) quotes this idea from Socrates as a springboard to discuss the view of the Sages, which he suggests is identical to that of Socrates. Featured most prominently in his argument is the fact that the term used to describe a person engaged in Torah study is \u201ctalmid chacham\u201d \u2013 a student of wisdom. Even the greatest sage, who has amassed encyclopedic knowledge and can plumb the depths of Talmudic analysis, is still called a student./\r\n\r\nTo bolster his idea, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv quotes the Baal HaTurim (Shemot 25:18), who suggests, based on the Gemara (Sukkah 5b), that the Cherubs, the Keruvim that sat above the ark were fashioned in the image of children. This understanding is based on the fact that the word Keruv is usually spelled kaf-reish-vov-vet, but in this instance, it is spelled without the vov (kaf-reish-vet). Rabbi Abbahu connects this to the Aramaic word ravya, which means child. The Keruv, is ke-ravya \u2013 like a child. The image of the child represents a never-ending curiosity, thirst, and quest to learn and discover./\r\n\r\nRabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz (Keli Yakar) finds the same idea embedded within the dimensions of the ark. He first observes that the dimensions of the Altar were five, by five, by three (5x5x3); the dimensions of the Table were two, by one, by one and a half (2x1x1.5); and the dimensions of the Ark were two and a half, by one and a half, by one and half (2.5x1.5x1.5). The Altar was comprised of whole numbers, the Table of a mixture of whole and half numbers, and the Ark of completely half numbers. While he also explains the symbolism of this pattern for the Altar and the Table, for our purposes, his explanation of the Ark\u2019s half numbers is pertinent. The reason, he argues, is because the Ark represents Torah and half measurements represent incompleteness. Every learner should take the perspective that they are not a finished product. There is always more to learn. There is always room to grow./\r\n\r\nThis message is countercultural. We are a society obsessed with certificates, grades, accolades, and accomplishments. Our systems, institutions, and classrooms tend to foster achievement orientations. Yet, we can never become complete and whole in our learning \u2013 there is no graduation. To the extent that we can cultivate a mastery orientation for ourselves, for our children and for our students, the better learners we will become. We are all students, we are all keruvim, we are all children, we are all incomplete. The only thing we really know, is that we know nothing.'},{ID:23,parshaId:19,vort:"How often do you feel awe, admiration, and elevation while witnessing beauty and excellence?/\r\n\r\nAppreciation is one of the 24 character strengths and virtues outlined by psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman that enhance well-being. They define appreciation as the \u201cability to find, recognize, and take pleasure in the existence of goodness in the physical and social worlds.\u201d/\r\n\r\nPeterson and Seligman make an important distinction between three different types of goodness that one can feel and show appreciation for: 1) physical beauty, 2) skill or talent, 3) virtue or moral goodness. Mar\xeda Luisa Mart\xednez-Mart\xed and her colleagues reported in a recent study that individuals who score high on an Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence scale (which includes all three types of appreciation) generally report higher senses of well-being, life-satisfaction, purpose, and hope. They also report more impactful spiritual experiences, and are more empathetic, sympathetic, and concerned for the well-being of others./\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the sheer number of verses related to the construction of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the clothing of the Kohanim, that the Torah is deeply interested in transmitting a theology of beauty. Moses is commanded in the beginning of this week's Torah portion to make holy garments for his brother Aharon \u201clekavod u-le-tifaret\u201c \u2013 \u201cfor honor and for beauty\u201d (Shemot 28:2). The commentators differ on the exact meaning of the verse. Elements of the dispute rest on a textual ambiguity, which perhaps also reflects a deeper spiritual message./\r\n\r\nTextually, it is unclear which noun \u201cfor honor and beauty\u201d is modifying. Some understand that the clothing itself must be honorable and beautiful, so that if it is ripped or worn out, it would be invalid (Ralbag). Others argue that it is the Kohen Gadol, the High Priest, who is being honored and beautified by the clothing, as the garments described were also worn by royalty (Ramban)./\r\n\r\nStill others argue that it is not the clothing, nor is it the Kohen Gadol, who is being honored, but it is God (Sforno) or the Mishkan (Rambam) that is being beautified by the special clothing. Regardless of which approach we take, it is evident that there is an inherent value in magnifying and glorifying the physical beauty as it relates to deeply sacred rituals. The spiritual experience is enhanced by the surrounding physical beauty./\r\n\r\nYet, the sense of awe and appreciation is not limited to the realm of just physical beauty. Inherent in witnessing and experiencing the presence of the Kohen Gadol was also an appreciation of skill and talent. As is evident from the verses describing the performance of the sacrificial rituals, especially in the context of Yom Kippur, the work of the Kohen Gadol was complicated and required practice, precision, and determination. No doubt, spectators witnessing the Kohen Gadol (and even modern readers imagining the ancient scene) feel a sense of awe and appreciation of the skill and talent required to successfully execute the rituals./\r\n\r\nIn his commentary, Aderet Eliyahu, Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Baghdad, better known as the Ben Ish Chai, adds the final dimension of appreciation into the mix, namely, virtue and moral goodness. He argues that clothing cannot be an inherent symbol of character. If someone who is known to demonstrate low moral fortitude wears royal or regal attire, the contrast between his or her internal flaws and the external pretense, makes the wearer even lower in the eyes of others. It is only if the onlookers know for certain the pristine character of the wearer of the garments that the clothing can enhance his or her stature./\r\n\r\nThere is a Talmudic tradition that the Kohen Gadol could only emerge from the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur if he was of high moral character. Therefore, when the Kohen Gadol emerged on Yom Kippur, everyone was aware of his virtue. The beauty of his priestly garments was integrally intertwined with the beauty of his virtue, character, and moral goodness./\r\n\r\nThe Mishkan, and particularly the role of the Kohen Gadol within it, provides a paradigm for us to nurture our own sense of appreciation. If we can learn how to cultivate this trait within a spiritual paradigm, combining an appreciation of beauty, talent, and virtue, we can enhance and deepen our relationship with ourselves, with others, and with God."},{ID:24,parshaId:20,vort:"It happened as he [Moses] drew near the camp and saw the calf and the dances, that Moses' anger flared up. He threw down the Tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain #(32:19)/\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable Midrash which states that when God said to Moses, \u201cGo, descend \u2013 for your people that you brought up from Egypt have become corrupt,\u201d Moses held on to the Tablets and did not believe that the Israelites had sinned. He said, \u201cIf I do not see it, I do not believe it,\u201d for the Torah says, \u201cIt happened as he [Moses] drew near the camp and saw the calf and the dances,\u201d hence, he did not break the Tablets until he saw it with his own eyes./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash continues, \u201cWoe unto those people who testify to what they did not see. Is it possible that Moses did not believe it when God said to him, `your people have become corrupt?' But Moses wished to teach the Israelites proper behavior. Even if one hears something critical from a trustworthy person, one is not permitted to accept his word and take action on it if he does not see it himself\u201d (Shemos Rabbah 46:1)./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash seems to say that Moses did in fact believe God, but that he acted as if he did not in order to set an example for the people. However, the Midrash earlier is very clear: \u201cMoses held on to the Tablets and did not believe that the Israelites had sinned. He said, `If I do not see it, I do not believe it.'\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe resolution of this apparent contradiction is that Moses did not believe God because he knew that God did not wish that he believe Him. Moses knew that God desires only what is proper, and inasmuch as it is proper not to believe anything negative about others unless one sees it oneself, God did not want Moses to believe Him. Moses did not act \u201cas if.\u201d His example and teaching were factual./\r\n\r\nWe find a similar incident when God told Moses to go to Egypt to deliver the Israelites from their enslavement. Moses said, \u201cI must first ask permission from my father-in-law, Jethro\u201d (Rashi, Exodus 4:18). How dare he refuse to follow God's command until he received Jethro's permission? Rabbi Chaim Shmulevits explains that Moses understood God's will, that inasmuch as Jethro was hospitable to him when he fled from Pharaoh, God would not want him to depart without seeking his permission./\r\n\r\nThe Torah forbids speaking lashon hara (defamatory speech) and rechilus (talebearing). The Chafetz Chaim says that one who accepts lashon hara or talebearing is as sinful as the one who spreads them. In fact, even when one does see an apparent wrongdoing with one's own eyes, one should still give the person the benefit of doubt and assume that there must be compelling reasons for the person's action (Ethics of the Fathers 1:6)./\r\n\r\nIf we observe Hillel's principle, \u201cDo not do anything to others that you would not want done to you,\u201d we can avoid both speaking and listening to lashon hara and talebearing."},{ID:25,parshaId:21,vort:"Every wise-hearted person among you shall come and make everything that God has commanded #(35:10) Every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands (Exodus, 35:25)\r\nHe [God] filled them with a wise heart to do ... every craft (35:35)\r\nThe wise-hearted among those doing the work made the Tabernacle (36:8)/\r\n\r\nThe repeated references to the trait of \u201cwise-hearted\u201d cannot be without significance./\r\n\r\nOn the verse, \u201cEvery man whose heart inspired him came\u201d (Exodus 35:21), Ramban comments that none of the Israelites had learned the skills necessary for the work of the Sanctuary and the vestments. However, because they were intensely motivated to do the Divine will, they discovered that they were in fact able to do the skilled craftsmanship. This might be interpreted as a miraculous endowment of skills they had not had. However, the words of Ramban indicate that it was not an endowment of something new. Rather, it was a discovery that they had these skills within them./\r\n\r\nThis is an important lesson. Clinically, I repeatedly encounter people who are not aware of their inherent skills and personality assets. In my writings on self-esteem I point out that not only are many people oblivious of their personality assets and potential, but even when these are pointed out to them, they persist in denying them. One can only wonder why intelligent people are not able to accept such factual information./\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon in psychotherapy to repeatedly point out something to a patient, but it does not have the slightest impact upon him. After regularly pointing this out for a year and a half, there is a sudden insight. The patient may then say, \u201cDoctor, I've been coming here for a year and a half. Why haven't you ever pointed this out to me before?\u201d/\r\n\r\nDuring the year and a half of therapy, when the therapist interpreted the patient's symptoms, the patient said, \u201cI understand everything you've said, but it doesn't make me feel any better.\u201d I can conclude only that intellect is subordinate to emotion, and that intellectual knowledge that is not accompanied by emotional knowledge is ineffective. If there are emotional factors that do not allow a person to accept something about himself, whether it is something good or something bad, no amount of intellectual information will register./\r\n\r\nAccording to Ramban, this is what happened with the Israelites. Many people did not have an inkling that they had the requisite skills for the intricate work in crafting the vessels, vestments and curtains of the Sanctuary. But their devotion to God and their desire to do His will resulted in \u201ctheir hearts being elevated in the ways of God\u201d (II Chronicles 17:6). Their spirits soared, and the emotional fervor enabled them to discover the skills within them./\r\n\r\nWe usually think of wisdom as associated with the mind and brain rather than with the heart. We associate the heart with emotions rather than with wisdom. The Torah repeatedly refers to the \u201cwise-hearted\u201d to indicate the overriding influence of emotion over intellect, and that only when one's emotions permit can one implement the powers of the intellect./\r\n\r\nWe have untouched reserves of both physical and mental abilities. Under conditions of stress, people have been known to perform physical feats that they never thought were within their capacities. There is reason to believe that some geniuses were not of such superior intellect, but rather that their emotional investment allowed them to fully utilize their potential./\r\n\r\nThis is an important principle in education. If we can stimulate interest and desire for knowledge in children, they are likely to excel in their studies. A good teacher is, therefore, one who can reach the students in a way that they become \u201cwise-hearted.\u201d"},{ID:26,parshaId:22,vort:"Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood (37:1).\r\n\r\nRashi says that because Bezalel dedicated himself to the work of the Ark more than others, it bears his name: the Ark that Bezalel made.\r\n\r\nIn Exodus 25:10, the Torah says, \u201cThey shall make an Ark of acacia wood.\u201d The Midrash notes that for all the other appurtenances of the Sanctuary, God said to Moses, \u201cYou shall make,\u201d but in the case of the Ark, He said, \u201cThey shall make.\u201d The Midrash explains this exception; God said to Moses, \u201cLet everyone participate in the fashioning of the Ark so that all will have the merit of Torah\u201d (Shemos Rabbah 34:3). There seems to be a bit of a conflict here. God instructed that everyone should share in the construction of the Ark, yet it appears as though Bezalel did it almost single-handedly.\r\n\r\nRabbi Boruch Sorotzkin says that the message herein is that when Torah is involved, one should not assume that others will do their part, but rather act as if one were the only person who could carry out the responsibility. Although all the Israelites were obligated to share in the Ark, Bezalel approached it as if he were the only one available to fashion it.\r\n\r\nThere is the well-known story of the shul that asked all its members to donate a cup of wine. Each member reasoned that everyone else would donate wine, so he could get away with putting in a cup of water. When they came to fetch wine from the barrel, it was all pure water! That is what may happen when one relies on others to do the task. Every person may rationalize that others will do it.\r\n\r\nRabbi Sorotzkin's observation is relevant to all commandments as well as to Torah. When there is something to be done, do not rely on others, even if they share the responsibility. Act as if you were the only person available and capable of doing the task."},{ID:27,parshaId:23,vort:"In their book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), Drs. Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson explain the psychology behind why many of us have difficulty admitting mistakes. They describe the various tricks our brains use to defend our egos from noticing our shortcomings, including cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, na\xefve-realism, and memory distortions. The basic gist behind all of these tricks is that our mind \u201cyearns for consonance and rejects information that questions our beliefs, decisions, or preferences.\u201d/\r\n\r\nYet, the thrust of Tavris and Aronsons\u2019s argument is that we could go a long way to compensate for these cognitive errors by just being aware that they exist and are in danger of deluding reality./\r\n\r\nThe Torah describes four different inadvertent sins that require different sacrificial atonements, depending on who sinned: the High Priest, the court, the leader, or a regular individual. While for the High Priest, the court, and the individual, the Torah frames the sacrifices based on the condition of \u201cif\u201d they sin (\u201cim\u201d), when it comes to the leader, the verse uses the word \u201casher\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhen the leader sins.\u201d Commentators are bothered by the assumption. Why do we assume the inevitably of the leader\u2019s sin?/\r\n\r\nIbn Ezra circumvents the problem by arguing that the word \u201casher\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201cim\u201d and also means \u201cif,\u201d not \u201cwhen.\u201d Others take the change in wording more seriously and suggest that there is a fundamental difference between a leader and the other three groups. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks quotes three different explanations including that a leader is more prone to arrogance (Sforno), is more involved in secular pursuits (Rabbi Eliyahu Munk) and can be easily strayed by popular opinion (Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk). Rabbi Sacks suggests a fourth answer which stresses the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in making political decisions./\r\n\r\nRashi, quoting the midrash, takes the discussion in another direction by focusing on a different function of the word \u201casher,\u201d as it also doubles as an allusion to the word \u201cashrei,\u201d meaning happy, praiseworthy, or fortunate. \u201cFortunate is the generation,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhose leader sets his heart to bring an atonement sacrifice even for an inadvertent sin; how much more certain is it that he will repent for his willful sins.\u201d It isn\u2019t easy for any of us to admit our mistakes. We have so many cognitive distortions that conceal our mistakes from our awareness. It is even more common for leaders to not see their mistakes because the stakes are higher. It is indeed worthy of pausing and celebrating such leaders who are willing to admit their mistakes and are able to model proper behavior for others./\r\n\r\nHow do we overcome all the obstacles that prevent us from seeing our mistakes? I believe the answer lies within a careful reading of Rashi\u2019s commentary. If we pay close attention, we will notice that Rashi formulates the idea slightly differently than the sources he is quoting from. The Tosefta, the Talmud Bavli, the Sifra, and the Yalkut Shimoni all write \u201cfortunate is the generation whose leader offers a sacrifice for his unintentional sins.\u201d Rashi adds the words \u201cnotein leiv\u201d \u2013 \u201csets his heart.\u201d \u201cFortunate is the generation whose leader is \u201cnotein leiv\u201d sets his heart to offer a sacrifice for his unintentional sins. The path to be able to admit mistakes is to pay attention \u2013 to be \u201cnotein leiv.\u201d As Drs. Tavris and Aronson argued, the way to overcome our biases is to be aware that we have them in the first place. If we are become aware of the tricks our minds play on us to protect our egos and become mindful and pay attention, we have a chance at being able to recognize and admit when we make mistakes."},{ID:28,parshaId:24,vort:"New Year\u2019s is a time for a new you. When we change the calendar from one year to the next it serves as a marker and motivator for personal change. Wharton professor Katherine Milkman termed this psychological phenomenon the \u201cfresh start effect.\u201d In explaining the mindset behind this theory on Freakonomics Radio, Milkman argued that we dissociate ourselves from last year\u2019s failures \u2013 \u201cThose are not me. That\u2019s old me. That\u2019s not new me. New me isn\u2019t going to make these mistakes.\u201d/\r\n\r\nHer formulation is reminiscent of Maimonides\u2019 language in his Laws of Repentance, where he writes that part of the change process requires a symbolic name change, as if to say, \u201cI am a different person and not the same one who sinned.\u201d\r\n\r\nMilkman and her colleagues hypothesized that this dissociation with our past selves was not just confined to New Year\u2019s but that there were other temporal landmarks throughout the calendar that spark improved behavior. To test their theory, they downloaded eight years\u2019 worth of Google searches for the word \u201cdiet\u201d and found that people search \u201cdiet\u201d more at the outset of a new week, month, year, and semester; or after a birthday or a holiday. They found similar results when investigating when people go to the gym \u2013 there is a boost in attendance after these \u201cnew\u201d opportunities for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nFrom a Jewish calendric perspective, Rosh Hashanah, the Ten Days of Repentance, and Yom Kippur embody a fresh start perspective, where change is embedded within the framework of the new year. However, to constrain change and fresh starts to just that time of the year is severely limiting. Each new month also presents an opportunity for transformation. This is highlighted with Rosh Chodesh celebrations, and is especially pertinent for those who have the custom of fasting and repenting the day before each new month (known as Yom Kippur Katan).\r\n\r\nYet, the opportunities aren\u2019t limited to new years or new months. Parshat Tzav begins with the laws of the burnt offering. An essential part of the sacrificial process was that the priest ceremoniously separated the ashes of the previous day\u2019s sacrifice and removed them from the camp (Vayikra 6:4). Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch explains that this act signifies that every day is a fresh start, calling us \u201cto go to our mission with full new devotion and sacrifice.\u201d One application of this symbolism, Rabbi Hirsch asserts, is the importance of not being complacent with yesterday\u2019s accomplishment, starting fresh with the same energy despite the somewhat repetitive nature of existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can suggest another message. Despite the \u201cburnt\u201d parts of yesterday, we are called on each day to start fresh. Remove yesterday\u2019s shortcomings and start from scratch today. While new years, months, and weeks, provide an opportunity for reflection, the truth is, that every day does as well. The imperative of repentance and improvement is one that is operative all year long, not just during the High Holidays.\r\n\r\nLooking for temporal landmarks on the calendar to give us boosted motivation to change is important. But we don\u2019t have to wait for the first of the year, the first of the month, or next Monday until we start improving. Every day is a fresh start."},{ID:29,parshaId:25,vort:"On the Eight Day of the inauguration of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle, a celebration is in order as God\u2019s Glory appears and a fire descends, symbolizing the successful acceptance of the sacrifices. Yet the elation turns quickly to tragedy, when another fire descends, but this time, to consume Aharon\u2019s sons, Nadav and Avihu, after they offer a foreign fire on the altar./\r\n\r\nAharon is silent. The ceremony must proceed as planned. The usual regulations of mourning are suspended. Moshe informs Aharon and his remaining children to eat from the Meal and Peace offerings as intended but does not mention anything specifically about the Sin offering. When he discovers that they burned the whole animal and didn\u2019t eat it, Moshe expresses anger./\r\n\r\nAharon defends the decision, arguing that after all he has experienced on that day, God wouldn\u2019t want them to eat that sacrifice. Moshe hears Aharon\u2019s argument and is pleased. The Sages explain that Moshe knew the law that they shouldn\u2019t have eaten the Sin offering, but forgot. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabba 13) identifies this as one of the three times Moshe became angry and consequently, forgot a law./\r\n\r\nAnother Midrash (Sifra) reports a fascinating dispute between two sages as to the sequencing of the problem. Did Moshe\u2019s anger cause him to make a mistake or did his mistake cause him to get angry? Chanania ben Yehuda argues that Moshe\u2019s anger led to his mistake. However, Rabbi Yehuda questions this analysis because if it wasn\u2019t for the mistake, he never would have become angry in the first place. The mistake led to the anger, not the other way around.1\r\n\r\nIt is unclear which sage is correct with regards to Moshe. Yet, for the psychological message, we don\u2019t have to pick a winner. They are both true. Anger both causes mistakes and is rooted in mistakes. The fact that anger causes mistakes is quite obvious. When we are angry, we tend to speak or act in ways that we later regret. Mistakes caused by anger destroy careers, damage relationships, and devastate families./\r\n\r\nLess apparent, yet perhaps more important, anger is also rooted in mistakes. Some argue that we cannot control the way we feel. Emotions, they argue, just happen to us without any conscious control. Yet, mounting evidence indicates otherwise. Our thoughts, beliefs, expectations, perceptions and attitudes impact the way we feel. A core principle of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is that by working on identifying, challenging, and changing our thought processes, we can change our emotional experiences to be healthier.2/\r\n\r\nThe thoughts that lead to an unhealthy anger are almost always mistaken. They are what are referred to as cognitive distortions or irrational beliefs. While we should always be hesitant of critiquing Moses, following the lead of the two Midrashim above, at the very least we can try to glean a lesson for our own self-improvement. In Moshe\u2019s case it seems his mistake was that he didn\u2019t remember all the facts of the case and then jumped to the conclusion that the others were wrong./\r\n\r\nAre we prone to jumping to conclusions, to making judgments before we have all the facts? Do we yell at our kids, siblings, parents, friends, coworkers, or employees, before clarifying the whole story? If yes, it may be worth our while to work on training our brains to slow down, examine the situation from all sides and ask clarifying questions of others. By changing our mistaken thinking, we can change our emotions and help avoid the consequences that unhealthy emotions have on our relationships./\r\n\r\n1.See Ohr HaChaim for a fuller analysis of the Midrash.

In his 1946 book, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, he chronicles his experiences in Auschwitz and the tenets of his psychotherapeutic method, logotherapy, which he argues is what helped him cope through the traumatic and horrific experiences of the Holocaust. Three of his essential and related messages are that (1) we all have free will to choose our mental responses, even amidst suffering; (2) our mission in life should be to seek meaning, not to merely gain pleasure or to avoid pain; and (3) we obtain meaning by living a life that focuses on values and ideals./\r\n\r\nIn describing the wisdom, internal structure, and depth of the Hebrew alphabet, the mystical work Sefer Yetzira highlights the connection between the word nega (affliction; spelled nun-gimmel-ayin) and the word oneg (pleasure; spelled ayin-nun-gimmel): \u201cThere is no good higher than oneg and no evil lower than nega.\u201d The word nega is used often in Parshiyot Tazria and Metzora to describe the disease of tzara\u2019at. Building off of the Sefer Yetzira, several commentators reflect on the relationship of the nega of tzara\u2019at to the inverse concept of oneg, pleasure./\r\n\r\nFor example, Rabbi Yissocher Frand quotes and eloborates on the Chidushei HaRim, pointing out that the only difference between oneg and nega is the place of the ayin within the word. In oneg the ayin is in the front of the word and in nega it is at the end. When explaining the laws pertaining to tzara\u2019at of clothing, the pasuk states that if after washing, \u201cthe affliction has not changed its appearance (ha-nega lo hafach et eyno)\u2026 it is contaminated\u2026 (Vayikra 12:55). The Chidushei HaRim suggests a homiletic reading. The term \u201cet eyno,\u201d translated as \u201cits appearance\u201d can be read as \u201cits ayin,\u201d referencing the letter ayin, with an additional layer of meaning, namely, its eye, or vision. The difference between a nega and oneg is a matter of ayin, or perspective./\r\n\r\nTo be clear, oneg in this context does not mean physical pleasure, nor does it necessarily mean a surreal, detached, obliviousness to pain. Oneg is a spiritual pleasure, which doesn\u2019t completely negate pain, but alleviates it by infusing meaning. It is the pleasure that comes when despite pain, one can change one\u2019s perspective and still commit oneself to living a life steeped in values and ideals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is why, as the Sefat Emet explains, the impurity of the metzora lasts seven days, as it ensures that he or she experiences Shabbat as part of the process. The pleasure and meaning one derives from Shabbat are reparative. Sefat Emet also points out that the word tzara\u2019at (tzadi-reish-ayin-tav) has the same letters as the word atzeret (ayin-tzadi-reish-tav), which is a reference to the holiday of Shavuot. Shavuot, representing the acceptance and study of Torah, provides the antidote for the pain and suffering of tzara\u2019at./\r\n\r\nWhile we generally hope to avoid pain and suffering, in cases where it is out of our control, the only thing in our control, is our response. While it is incredibly challenging, we can work on shifting our perspective and investing our lives with value and meaning, despite the pain. By suffusing our lives with the meaning that permeates a Torah lifestyle, we can hopefully change any nega we may experience to one of oneg."},{ID:31,parshaId:27,vort:"If a person (adam) will have on his skin . . .a tzaraas affliction (Vayikra, 13:2)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud is very clear that the affliction of tzaraas (the exact nature of which is unknown to us) is a punishment for having spoken lashon hara, derogatory speech./\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word the Torah uses for \u201cperson\u201d in the above verse is adam. There are several other Hebrew words for \u201cperson\u201d: enosh, ish, gever. The ethical writings state that each refers to a level of spirituality, and adam represents the highest level. We must understand, therefore, the Torah's choice of the word adam for a person afflicted with tzaraas./\r\n\r\nThe Chafetz Chaim said that the juxtaposition of this portion of the Torah to that of the previous portion dealing with non-kosher animals is to teach us that people who may be meticulously careful about what goes into their mouths should be equally as scrupulous about what comes out of their mouths. There are sins which a Torah observant person would never do, but as for lashon hara, it is a rare person who is saved from it (Bava Basra 164b). Hence, even a spiritual person, adam, is vulnerable to lashon hara./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash relates that a peddler went through the streets shouting, \u201cWho wishes to buy an elixir of life?\u201d R' Yannai, who was engrossed in his Torah study, asked to see his wares. The peddler said to him, \u201cFor you I have nothing.\u201d Upon R' Yannai's insistence, the peddler took out a Book of Psalms and showed him the verse, \u201cWho is the person who desires life and loves days that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech\u201d (Psalms 34:13-14). R' Yannai then said, \u201cAll my life I have been reciting this psalm, but I never understood it until this peddler pointed it out to me\u201d (Vayikra Rabbah 16:2)./\r\n\r\nThis Midrash has puzzled many Torah scholars. What was in these verses that he had never grasped previously? The words of the psalm could not be any clearer: Guarding one's tongue from lashon hara is conducive to long life./\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may understand this by examining the Talmudic statement that the remedy for lashon hara is the study of Torah (Arachin 15b). A number of commentaries ask, In what way is Torah study a penance for lashon hara? The Jewish law is that if you have offended someone, it is essential that you make amends to that person and ask his forgiveness. They answer that it is not the study of Torah per se that constitutes penance. Rather, the study of Torah will enable a person to understand the gravity of lashon hara so that he will do what is necessary for penance./\r\n\r\nThe gravity of lashon hara can be seen in the episode of Joseph and his brothers, which was brought about by his speaking derogatorily about them (Genesis 37:2), and in what happened to the prophetess, Miriam, when she spoke improperly regarding Moses (Numbers 12:1-10). To this very day, we are suffering the consequences of the lashon hara delivered by the spies to Moses (ibid. 13:31-32). This should make one cognizant of how far-reaching the effects of lashon hara can be, and how diligent one must be to do proper teshuvah./\r\n\r\nWhile the mitzvah of studying Torah is extraordinarily great (Shabbos 127a), the Talmud points out that Torah can be a double-edged sword. \u201cIf one merits, Torah can be an elixir of life; if one is not virtuous, Torah can be a deadly poison\u201d (Yoma 72b). How penetrating these words are! If used improperly, Torah can be destructive./\r\nThe impact of derogatory speech depends on the character of the speaker. If a person who has little credibility makes a negative comment about someone, people are likely to dismiss it as worthless babble. However, if the speaker is a person of stature, a scholar whose opinion carries some weight, the attitude towards his words is, \u201cIf he says so, it must be true. He knows what he is talking about.\u201d The more learned a person is and the higher he is held in esteem, the more his words are taken seriously./\r\n\r\nThe Baal Shem Tov taught that every human character trait can be put to good use. But what about vanity? This is so abominable a trait that it repels the Divine Presence (Arachin 15b). How can vanity ever have a positive application?/\r\nWe can see, however, that even vanity can have a redeeming feature. Before making a negative comment about someone, do not be humble and think of yourself as an insignificant person whose words will not be heeded. This is the time when vanity can temporarily be put to good use. \u201cI must be careful of what I say. People are not likely to dismiss my words lightly. I am an important person, and my words can have a great impact.\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe greater a Torah scholar a person is, the more he must be careful of his speech. The words of an esteemed Torah scholar will be taken seriously. If he speaks negatively about someone, he has allowed his Torah scholarship to become a negative force. The Midrash says that lashon hara destroys three people: the speaker, the listener and the one about whom it is spoken (Devarim Rabbah 5:10). If Torah scholarship gives credibility to one's lashon hara, it indeed becomes \u201ca deadly poison.\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe man who was peddling the \u201celixir of life\u201d was not an unlearned person. He was trying to teach people mussar, personal growth. He did not believe that a great Torah scholar like R' Yannai was in need of his teaching. When he told R' Yannai that his teaching about lashon hara was not relevant for Torah scholars, R' Yannai remarked, \u201cI was unaware that people had this mistaken impression. To the contrary, it is those who are Torah scholars who have great need for this elixir of life, because Torah has value only if one is virtuous. Negligence on the part of a Torah scholar, particularly in speaking lashon hara, can seriously distort the value of Torah.\u201d/\r\nWe can be spared from lashon hara if we incorporate the second half of the verse, \u201cloves days that he may see good.\u201d In his introductory morning prayer, R' Elimelech of Lizhensk says, \u201cHelp us to see the good in our fellows, and not their defects.\u201d/\r\n\r\nIf we concentrate on looking for the good in people, we will have no need to make negative comments about anyone."},{ID:32,parshaId:28,vort:"\u201cEven when they are in a state of contamination, the Divine Presence is with them\u201d (Yoma 57a)./\r\n\r\nAlthough disobeying the Divine will sets up a barrier between man and God, it is somewhat like a one-way mirror. We cause ourselves to be distant from God, but He is never distant from us. This is rather easy to understand. We sometimes see children who reject their parents, but regardless of how defiant the child may be, the parents' love for him is as intense as ever, and they long for his return to them./\r\n\r\nWhen R' Mendel of Kotzk first joined the court of R' Simchah Bunim of P'shis'che, the latter asked him, \u201cYoung man, where is God?\u201d R' Mendel answered, \u201cThe entire world is full of His glory.\u201d R' Simchah Bunim repeated, \u201cYoung man, I asked you, where is God?\u201d R' Mendel answered, \u201cThere is no place that is devoid of Him.\u201d R' Simchah Bunim persisted, \u201cYoung man, I am asking you, where is God?\u201d R' Mendel said, \u201cIf my answers do not satisfy you, then you tell me.\u201d R' Simchah Bunim said, \u201cGod can be found wherever He is welcomed.\u201d/\r\n\r\n\u201cHe who is haughty of eye and large of desire, him I cannot tolerate\u201d (Psalms 101:5). Of a vain and arrogant person the Talmud quotes God as saying, \u201cHe and I cannot share the same dwelling\u201d (Arachin 15b). God is indeed everywhere, but He withdraws His presence from a vain and arrogant person./\r\n\r\nCommitting a sin is not necessarily a denial or rejection of God. A person may simply have been overwhelmed by an urge that he did not suppress, or may not have realized that a sin causes him to be distant from God. However, a vain, egotistical person is one who is his own god. Inasmuch as there cannot be two gods, if a person thinks himself to be god, he cannot believe in the true God. There is no form of idolatry as absolute as the person who worships himself./\r\n\r\nIn my writings on self-esteem, I suggested that vanity and conceit are desperate defenses whereby a person tries to cope with a sense of unworthiness. I was thrilled to find that no less an authority than Rabbeinu Yonah validates this concept. \u201cThe vain person seeks to compensate for his feeling of defectiveness by means of grandiosity\u201d (Rabbeinu Yonah al HaTorah, p. 156). A person with healthy self-esteem does not seek the praise and recognition of others to remind him that he has value./\r\n\r\nIf a person truly believes that he possesses a Divine neshama, soul, he will realize that he has great worth, and even if he may have gone astray in his behavior, he is nevertheless worthy by virtue of his Divine neshama. Anyone with a profound feeling of unworthiness must be in denial that he has within himself the breath of God./\r\n\r\nMan's closeness to God is by virtue of his soul, which craves to be united with its Source. Denial of having a Divine neshama precludes a close relationship with God./\r\n\r\nGod is with us even if we have sinned. As long as we feel a desire to be close to God, we know ourselves to be of His essence, and that we are capable of becoming more spiritual. This opens the door to teshuvah, repentance, and this is why the above verse is contained in the narrative of the Yom Kippur service."},{ID:33,parshaId:29,vort:"You shall love your fellow as yourself (Vayikra 19:18)./\r\n\r\nRashi explains that this Torah portion was addressed to the entire assembly of Israel because it contains the greater part of the body of Torah. It is possible that \u201ccontains the greater part of the body of Torah\u201d refers to the above verse. Indeed, Rabbi Akiva said that this verse is \u201cthe all-encompassing principle of Torah\u201d (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 9:4)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Akiva's statement is sometimes translated as, \u201cThis verse is the cardinal or primary rule of Torah.\u201d This is an inaccurate translation. Rabbi Akiva's words are that this is a klal gadol, which means \u201ca great, all-encompassing principle\u201d of Torah, and this has a broad implication./\r\n\r\nA klal is a general principle under which there are many pratim (specifics). Each specific item must have the characteristic of the klal. If any specific item does not have the characteristic of the klal, then it does not belong there. For example, \u201canimate objects\u201d is a klal. A rock lacks the characteristic of animation, hence it cannot be classified under that klal./\r\n\r\nOne of the ethicists said that inasmuch as \u201cYou shall love your fellow as yourself\u201d is the \u201cgreat klal\u201d of Torah, this means that it encompasses all 613 mitzvot, and that each mitzvah must partake of the characteristic of the klal. Every mitzvah must relate to ahavat Yisrael (love for a fellow Jew), and must contribute to ahavat Yisrael. Therefore, he concludes, if a person does not have an increase in ahavat Yisrael after the performance of a mitzvah, that mitzvah was not done properly. A properly performed mitzvah must contribute to ahavat Yisrael./\r\n\r\nThis statement was nothing less than shocking. I had considered some mitzvot I had done as being properly performed. My tefillin are top quality, and there were at least some times when I had proper kavannah (concentration). The matzah I ate at the seder was of the highest quality shmurah (supervision). The sounding of the shofar that I heard on Rosh Hashanah was without fault, and the esrog (citron) that I used for the mitzvah of the four species on Sukkot was free of the slightest blemish. I felt I had fulfilled these mitzvot properly. But I must confess that I did not feel an increase in ahavat Yisrael after these mitzvot. The argument that R' Akiva's klal necessitates ahavat Yisrael as an ingredient in every mitzvah is unassailable. Where was I lacking?/\r\n\r\nIt then occurred to me that I was overlooking something I say in davening every day. Is it not tragic that we may verbalize without thinking about what we are saying?/\r\n\r\nPrior to the opening prayer, Baruch She'amar, there is a short Kabbalistic declaration of intent that includes the phrase, \u201cI pray in the name of all Israel.\u201d This is not the same as praying for Israel, which we do abundantly in the Amidah and other prayers. Rather, this is a declaration of intent that I am not praying alone, but that I wish to share my prayer with all Israel. Whatever merits accrue from my prayer are not exclusively mine, but belong to all Israel./\r\n\r\nI found this same declaration of intent preceding the mitzvot of putting on the tallis and tefillin and the Counting of the Omer. Further research revealed that it is recommended that this declaration is recited prior to every mitzvah one performs./\r\n\r\nIf there were true unity among Jews, this declaration would not be necessary. Just as the mitzvah of shofar accrues to the entire person rather than just to the ear, so would the mitzvah of every Jew accrue to the credit of all Jews if they were united as one body. Alas, that highly desirable state does not exist, so we must make a declaration that we wish to share the mitzvah with all of Israel. Of course, all of Israel means without exception, and indeed, ahavat Yisrael should be without exception./\r\n\r\nR' Eliyahu Dessler says that there is a common misconception that you give to whomever you love. The reverse is true: you love to whomever you give. When you give to someone, you invest part of yourself in him, and since every person loves himself, you now love that part of you that resides in the other person (Michtav MeEliyahu vol. 1 p. 36)./\r\nIf we listen to the words we say and are sincere, then we can fulfill R' Akiva's principle. By sharing our mitzvos with others, we can generate love for fellow Jews."},{ID:34,parshaId:30,vort:"Toward the end of Parshat Emor we are presented with a description of the various holidays spanning the Jewish calendar. The seventh month \u2013 what we now call Tishrei \u2013 is jam-packed with holidays, starting with Rosh Hashanah, continuing with Yom Kippur, and culminating in Sukkot and Shemini Atzeret./\r\n\r\nAfter describing the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in great detail, Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch summarizes their essence as a buildup and counterpoint to the holiday of Sukkot. Both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of seriousness and somberness, permeated by negative emotions. Rosh Hashanah is a \u201ca day of Teruah, a day of shatteringly shaking us up out of ways of life displeasing to God\u201d and Yom Kippur makes us \u201cappear before God, \u2018poor\u2019 in every justification for further living and working\u201d (Judaica Press translation). In stark contrast, on Sukkot we celebrate by \u201ctaking of the produce of the earth to gain the joy of living and working in happiness before God.\u201d/\r\n\r\nRabbi Hirsch then adds one simple, yet powerful, observation. Both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are one day each, yet Sukkot is comprised of seven days. The lesson he gleans from this straightforward calculation is that the Torah is prescribing what our baseline mood should be throughout the year. It shouldn\u2019t be the \u201cbowed down broken feeling\u201d associated with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but the \u201chappy joy of life\u201d experienced while living \u201ca life faithfully devoted to duty,\u201d symbolized by the seven days of Sukkot./\r\n\r\nIf our status quo mood should be one of happiness, the challenge becomes, how do we work on getting to such a state?/\r\n\r\nThere is an entire field called positive psychology dedicated to the study of happiness and well-being. One important observation that several psychologists have made is that relentlessly pursuing happiness usually does not lead to happiness. Moreover, unless we learn how to understand and accept our negative emotions, we will also not likely find lasting happiness. Healthy negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, concern, guilt, and embarrassment serve functional value. If we try and suppress these negative emotions because they make us feel uncomfortable and we want to be happy, the less likely it is that we will actually be happy./\r\n\r\nPerhaps this idea is subtly hinted at within Rabbi Hirsch\u2019s comments as well. While our operating status quo to strive for is to serve God through happiness, we must also make time and psychological space for those more negative emotions. There is an important place for the \u201cbowed down broken feeling\u201d symbolized by Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and that must be experienced, if we want to build toward the happiness of Sukkot. Our pursuit of serving God with joy needs to incorporate a healthy expression of negative emotions, as well./\r\n\r\nThis may also be reflected in another aspect of the Jewish calendar mentioned in Parshat Emor, one that we are in the midst of currently, namely, the counting of the Omer. The counting is supposed to be \u201ctemimiot,\u201d meaning whole or complete. While wholeness in this context has a serial connotation to it, in the sense that we shouldn\u2019t miss a day, wholeness here can also hint at the concept of wholeness of personality. On the one hand, the counting of the Omer represents an exciting build up and progression, whether agriculturally or as a preparation for the giving of the Torah. On the other hand, it is a time (on a rabbinic level) of mourning and solemnness. Perhaps the \u201cwholeness\u201d of this time requires us to validate and experience both the positive and negative emotions simultaneously. With this, we serve God with our whole selves and it is within this wholeness we can truly experience psychological and spiritual flourishing."},{ID:35,parshaId:31,vort:"One of the most prominent citizens of Pressburg came to Rabbi Moshe Schreiber (Chasam Sofer) and asked for a private audience.

He opened his drawer and took out the money that comprised his entire savings. \u201cI will lend you one hundred gulden. Go to Leipzig and may God bless you with success.\u201d/\r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nThe man refused to take the money. \u201cI didn't come to you for money,\u201d he said, \u201cbut just to unburden myself of my distress.\u201d\r\n\r\nRabbi Schreiber insisted, however, that he take the money./\r\n\r\nAt Leipzig, the man met a merchant who suggested that he buy a huge amount of coffee, and knowing him to be a prosperous businessman, he sold it to him on credit. The next day there was a sizeable increase in the price of coffee and he sold it at a large profit. He made several other transactions which were very profitable, and was convinced that the Chasam Sofer's blessing had brought him this good fortune./\r\n\r\n\u201cI must bring the rabbi a gift,\u201d he said. Knowing that Rabbi Schreiber was an expert on diamonds, he bought a diamond ring./\r\n\r\nOn returning to Pressburg he returned the hundred gulden and gave the rabbi the ring. The rabbi admired the ring. \u201cIt is indeed a beautiful diamond,\u201d he said. He continued to examine the ring, repeatedly praising its beauty, its color, its purity. He then gave the ring to the merchant, saying, \u201cIt is a very beautiful ring. Use it in good health.\u201d/\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I brought the ring for you, rabbi,\u201d the merchant said. \u201cIt was only by virtue of your blessing that I had this extraordinary success.\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe Chasam Sofer said, \u201cHad I not lent you the money, I might have accepted the gift. However, inasmuch as I lent you the money, taking anything more than what I lent you might constitute taking interest.\u201d/\r\n\r\nAfter the merchant left, one of the Chasam Sofer's students asked him, \u201cWhy were you so lavish in praising the ring?\u201d/\r\n\r\nThe Chasam Sofer answered, \u201cBusinessmen lend money, and they have the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of not lending on interest, as the Torah says, 'If your brother becomes impoverished and his means falter\u2026 you shall strengthen him\u2026 Do not take from him interest and increase' (Vayikra 25:35-36). As a rabbi, when do I have the opportunity to fulfill this mitzvah? No one comes to me for a loan. Here I was presented with the unusual opportunity to fulfill this mitzvah by refusing the ring. The ring was a vehicle whereby I could fulfill this mitzvah by returning it. How could I not praise something that enabled me to fulfill a mitzvah?\"/\r\n\r\nWe are blessed with the opportunity to do mitzvot. We should cherish these precious opportunities."},{ID:36,parshaId:32,vort:"\u201cIf you will walk in My decrees and observe My commandments and perform them\u201d (Vayikra 26:3)./\r\n\r\nR' Simchah Bunim of P'shis'che pointed out that whereas the heavenly angels do not progress in holiness and remain forever in the state in which they were created, man should not remain static, but advance in spirituality every day of his life. This is what the prophet means: \u201cIf you walk in My ways and safeguard My charge I shall permit you movement among these immobile [angels]\u201d (Zechariah 3:7)./\r\n\r\nGod has enabled us to have \u201cmovement,\u201d i.e., to grow in spirituality in contrast to angels that remain stationary./\r\n\r\nR' Saadiah Gaon once lodged at an inn, and because the innkeeper did not know his identity, he was not accorded the honor due him but was treated decently like any other customer.

Is every day of our lives one of spiritual advancement? If not, then we are derelict in our roles as human beings. We do have the capacity to grow spiritually, and it is wrong to not do so./\r\n\r\nThe fact is that there is no standing in one place. If we are derelict in advancing ourselves spiritually, this failure sets us back and we regress spiritually. We are constantly in movement. If we do not move forward, we are slipping backward./\r\n\r\nThe wording of the Torah is precise. It is not enough to simply observe the mitzvot. We must do so in a way that we progress in spirituality."},{ID:37,parshaId:33,vort:"Muzafer Sherif was a Turkish born psychologist who moved to the United States for graduate school and moved back to Turkey in the 1930\u2019s to teach in Ankara University. He was imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement for criticizing the Nazi party and the Turkish government. He subsequently moved back to America, becoming a pioneering social psychologist./\r\n\r\nHe is known for one of the most famous experiments related to intergroup conflicts and resolutions. Sherif gathered 22 boys in Robbers Cave State Park in Oklahoma and divided them into two groups \u2013 the Eagles and the Rattlers. At first, the two groups did not interact with each other and naturally built their own group cohesion. In the second stage of the experiment, the two groups were placed in situations where they would have to compete for various rewards and resources. Consequently, hostility between the groups increased, engendering hatred and creating conflicts./\r\n\r\nFinally, the groups were made to interact without competition, but this itself did not decrease the conflict. Tensions decreased and intergroup cohesion was created only after the two groups were made to work together towards a mutual goal that required them to cooperate (termed a superordinate goal)./\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this week's Torah portion delineates the details of a census that God commanded Moses to take of the Jewish males over the age of twenty. The numbers presented are divided by the different tribes and the specific formation that the tribes took in the desert is described as well. The first verse communicates the exact date that God spoke to Moses, namely, the first day of the second month of the second year after they were taken out of Egypt. Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky asks, why is that they waited until the second year to take this census and create the tribal formations? Wouldn\u2019t it have made more sense to do this in the first year?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Kamenetsky explains that there is a danger inherent in the tribalism that is presented in this week's Torah portion. Separating by groups and standing behind flags creates an us-versus-them mentality. When people stand in groups behind their own flags, they will favor their own group and be hostile to the other groups. One way to overcome this natural human tendency is to create a unifying, superordinate goal. In our case, that is the function of the Torah. Only with the Torah in the center can we attempt to create a healthy, cooperative group dynamic. Only with the mishkan, the tabernacle, in the center of the formation could the tribes march around in their own group./\r\n\r\nThis is why God waited until the second year, after the Torah was given and after the mishkan became the epicenter. Only then was the danger of having different tribes mitigated./\r\n\r\nThis tension between the in-group and the out-group is highlighted by Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch as well. Introducing the census (Numbers, 1:1-2), God tells Moses to count the heads of the entire congregation of Israel (adat Bnei Yisrael) according to their families (lemishpechotam) and the house of their fathers (le-beit avotam). Rabbi Hirsch argues that adat Bnei Yisrael represents the unified whole of the people in the desert. However, there is a second aspect, focusing on the families and the households. This second part represents the individual differences between families and tribes. This diversity and uniqueness is important, but can be dangerous if not expressed within the context of a unified whole./\r\n\r\nAs we prepare for Shavuot, may we merit finding our own unique voices and contributions to the Jewish people, while not allowing these differences to create divisiveness. This can be accomplished if our focal point is serving God, not ourselves or our groups, and then we can stand unified in heart and mind as we accept the Torah."},{ID:38,parshaId:34,vort:"The struggle for self-control is one of the most important, hardest-fought battles of all time. Unfortunately, there are many casualties, and our will often loses to temptation. To become a nazir, we are told in this week's Torah portion, one must take a vow, which commits one to abstain from grape products, from defiling oneself to a human corpse and from having one\u2019s haircut./\r\n\r\nThe verse uses a strange word to describe the act of vowing, namely, yafli. Ibn Ezra presents two possibilities as to what the word could mean. The first is that it connotes setting oneself apart (yafrish). The second is that it means wonder (pelah). Most people just give into their temptation. The nazir\u2019s commitment to self-control, Ibn Ezra argues, is so rare and powerful as to be called wondrous. On the one hand, the Nazir inspires us to have more self-control, and on the other, reminds us that most people fail, or even worse, don\u2019t even try./\r\n\r\nThe topic that immediately precedes that of nazir is that of the sotah. A woman whose husband warns her in front of witnesses not to seclude herself with another man, and she does so anyways, must go through the sotah ceremony to determine whether she committed adultery. Intrigued by the juxtaposition of these two otherwise seemingly different concepts, the Midrash proposes a connection. Nazir comes after sotah because anyone who witnesses the downfall of the sotah will be so dedicated to avoiding such demise, that he or she will commit to not drinking any wine out of fear that wine could lead to adultery./\r\n\r\nThe connection the Midrash is making between nazir and sotah is not tangential or coincidental. It is revealing the core message behind both concepts. The ideal way to deal with temptations, both the mitzvah of sotah and the mitzvah of nazir are telling us, is by avoiding the battle in the first place. To avoid becoming a sotah, don\u2019t put yourself in an environment that is conducive to sin. This includes not drinking wine as well as avoiding situations of seclusion that are more primed for temptation./\r\n\r\nAlong comes the section about nazir and the idea becomes intensified. Usually the Sages are responsible for implementing additional restrictions as fences and barriers to protect Biblical commandments but the case of the nazir is one of the few examples where the Torah itself provides added restrictions serving to protect the original law. Don\u2019t just avoid wine, but avoid any grape products. Don\u2019t just avoid grape products, but avoid even approaching a vineyard!/\r\n\r\nIn a 2016 article entitled \u201cSituational Strategies for Self-Control,\u201d Dr. Angela Duckworth argues that situational strategies are the most salient and effective ones to avoid self-control failures, yet they are also the most underappreciated and underutilized. We often take the battle against temptation head on and eventually lose to that delicious looking piece of chocolate cake. We think we will be able to study, but become powerless to avoid the allure of our phones./\r\n\r\nThe smartest and most effective strategy is to not buy the chocolate cake in the first place and to leave our phone off when we want to focus./\r\n\r\nYes, the struggle for self-control is a difficult one, but perhaps we are going about it all wrong. Fighting a head-to-head battle between willpower and temptation is only a last resort. Many have fallen in the heat of passion or the intenseness of an emotion. The better way, learning from the sotah\u2019s mistakes and taking the lead from the Nazir, is to avoid the battle in the first place. Avoid temptations and situations that could lead to sin. In so doing, perhaps we can have better luck in succeeding in our self-control goals and become happier, healthier, and more spiritually refined people."},{ID:39,parshaId:35,vort:"Research on the \u201cvariety effect\u201d proves what most of us know after partaking of a smorgasbord. People tend to eat more when there are more options. When the color, flavor, or shape of a food is varied we ingest more than we do if there is just one choice. By satiating a range of sensory experiences, we are able to fulfill more desires with increased consumption. Perhaps unsurprisingly, variety related eating habits are linked to obesity./\r\n\r\nAfter over a year of consuming the manna, the Children of Israel had enough. Yes, it looked nice and tasted good, but food falling from the Heavens was not enough to prevent complaining. They wanted meat. They remembered with fondness the fish they ate in Egypt chinam (for free), as well as the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. Yet upon analysis, we are left wondering. Are cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic really that superior to the manna? Was the food in Egypt really that free and easy to come by that it beat the convenience of food falling from the sky?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash, cited by Rashi, is convinced that there is a deeper motivation behind the complaint. The Children of Israel couldn\u2019t be longing for the free food in Egypt, because according to the Midrash, there was no free food in Egypt. The Egyptians made them work tirelessly to find their own straw in order to make their own bricks \u2013 the Egyptians weren\u2019t exactly in the business of handing out free food. Rather, underneath the Children of Israel's complaints, either consciously or subconsciously, was a more serious protest. They missed not the free food, but the freedom from restraints. In Egypt they were free from mitzvot, and now they were constrained with rules and regulations./\r\n\r\nUnlike the Midrash, Ramban understands chinam (free) at face value. In Egypt, he suggests, they did have ease of access to food. If they worked by the river, they were allowed to catch and eat fish. If they worked in the fields, there was such an abundance, that the field owners allowed the Children of Israel to eat what they liked as they gathered the crops. Yes, they had to work, but they could eat whenever they wanted because it was so plentiful and available. Manna was also free financially, but it was not as free from restrictions. With the manna, the Children of Israel could only get a controlled portion within a specific schedule. The Meshech Chochma points out that they even had meat available to eat, but the only way to eat it was to bring it to the Ohel Moed, the Tent of Meeting. There was plenty of free food, but there were also restrictions./\r\n\r\nPerhaps an additional part of the complaint is tied to the monotony of the manna. It was the same food, every day. The nostalgia of cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic is not about taste, but variety. On a similar level, the Netziv proposes that the foods they requested represent different courses. Instead of just having one course of manna, the Children of Israel wanted appetizers, dips, and dessert to go along with it./\r\n\r\nGod was trying to teach them controlled, scheduled, spiritually-motivated eating. The Children of Israel rebelled and complained because they desired the unbounded, unrestricted, smorgasbord variety of eating that they were used to from Egypt. In our own lives, whether in the context of food or otherwise, we may have a natural desire for variety and freedom from constraints. Yet, the message of the manna and the aftermath of the complaint is that it is beneficial to curb this craving. In so doing, may we merit living more psychologically, physically, and spiritually healthy lives."},{ID:40,parshaId:36,vort:"There is a small, yet growing subfield within psychology called color psychology. Researchers in this field are interested in how people perceive, relate to, and respond differently to various colors. Some reactions that we have to colors may be based on biology. For instance, since blood rushes to the face when one becomes aggressive, the color red, in both humans and animals, is a signal of dominance. Other reactions to colors may be based on a learned association between the color and another object. For instance, a Yankee fan may feel happy when seeing blue pinstripes because he or she associates that color scheme with the team./\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this week's Torah portion we are informed of the mitzvah of tzitzit. We are commanded to place fringes on our garments, including a thread that is tekhelet. The purpose of doing so is stated explicitly within the verses, as they function to remind us of God\u2019s commandments and not to wander after our hearts and eyes. Later authorities debate the exact color of tekhelet. Some say it is blue, some violet, and some green. Others debate how many strings have to be tekhlet and how many are to be white./\r\n\r\nHow exactly does wearing fringed garments remind us of the mitzvot and prevent us from wandering after our hearts and eyes? Numerous explanations have been given, some focusing on number symbolism, others on the significance of garments, and still others on the importance of color. Focusing for now on this last category, the question becomes more specific: how does wearing blue/violet/green strings interspersed through white strings, remind us not to sin?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Meir (Menachot 43b) tells us that looking at tekhelet sets off a string of associations that keeps us from sinning. Tekhelet, which he seems to understand as being blue, is a similar color to the ocean, which is a similar color to the sky, which is a similar color to G-d\u2019s Throne of Glory. Ramban adds that within the word tekhelet are the words kol (all) and tachlit (purpose). Meaning at its core tekhelet reminds us of our mission in this world, which is to serve God by doing mitzvot and avoid sinning./\r\n\r\nWriting in the 15th century, Rabbi Isaac Arama suggests that there is another important moral significance embedded within tekhelet. The message is dependent on a medieval color theory which is not followed in modern times. The assumption was that there were seven colors that flowed on a spectrum: white, yellow, red, green, blue, purple and black. At the extremes of the spectrum were white and black, and sitting in the middle was green. Rabbi Arama, presumably understanding that tekhelet is green, argues that the symbolism behind tekhelet is that it is the middle ground between extremes. This serves as a model for our character traits that we should follow the middle path./\r\n\r\nUsing Rabbi Arama\u2019s precedent to interpret the message of tekhelet based on the color science of his time, perhaps there is another layer to tekhelet that we can add by viewing it through the prism of modern color psychology. In a fascinating article researching how colors impact marketing strategy, Lauren Labrecque and George Milne summarize previous findings as to the psychological significance of different colors. White, the total reflection of all of the colors, is associated with sincerity, purity, and peace. Blue, which along with violet represent the shortest wavelength of all of the colors, is associated with intelligence, trust, and duty. In contrast, colors on the longer end of the wavelength spectrum (like red, orange, and yellow) stimulate states of excitement and arousal, oftentimes emotions related to sin./\r\n\r\nAs the verses indicate, tzitzit function to counteract sin. Presupposing that tekhelet is blue, perhaps the duty and loyalty invoked by seeing blue and the purity associated with white, are meant as a counter to calm the excitement represented by the red of sin. In addition to the associations that lead to us to think of God\u2019s throne, the psychological symbolism of the colors themselves may serve as an intervention to arrest the arousal of sin and remind us to be loyal to God."},{ID:41,parshaId:37,vort:"When one reads the account of Korach's rebellion (Numbers 16:1-35), one is astounded by the incident. Not only was Moses the one who led the Jews from Egypt, but all the Israelites were eyewitnesses to the many miracles that were wrought through him. They saw him wave his staff over the Reed Sea, causing the waters to divide. There could be no doubt that he was commissioned by God to be the leader. How could anyone question the authenticity of Moses' leadership? It simply defies all logic./\r\n\r\nRashi quotes the Midrash which raises this question: How could Korach, a wise and learned person, act so foolishly? The Midrash answers that Moses had appointed another Levite to be leader of the tribe of Levi, and Korach was envious of this./\r\n\r\nYet, this does not fully answer the question. Can envy so deprive a person of logical thinking that one would deny the evidence of one's own eyes?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Chaim Shmulevitz (Sichos Mussar 5731:21) helps us understand this. He cites the Talmudic statement, \u201cEnvy, lust and pursuit of acclaim remove a person from the world\u201d (Ethics of the Fathers 4:28). The expression \u201cremove a person from the world\u201d is rather strange. Rabbi Shmulevitz explains that the usual deviation from proper behavior is a very gradual one. The Talmud says that the tactic of the yetzer hara, the evil inclination, is to seduce a person to commit a very minor infraction, then lead him on to progressively more serious transgressions (Shabbos 108b). That is the nature and order of the world. The yetzer hara will not entice a person into doing something patently absurd./\r\n\r\nHowever, if a person is overtaken by envy, one escapes the natural order of the world. One is no longer bound by logic. The passion of envy can be so great that it can overwhelm all rational thought, and leave one vulnerable to the yetzer hara's seduction to behave in the most irrational manner. Envy indeed removes a person from the natural order of the world./\r\n\r\nThat is what happened with Korach. Moses understood this, and delayed the trial until the next day (see Rashi to Numbers 16:5)./\r\n\r\nThe Korach episode conveys a most important teaching. We are all vulnerable to envy, and envy is not a difficult emotion to identify. If you feel yourself being envious, do nothing for a while. Envy can suspend all logical thinking and make one do things that one will regret./\r\n\r\nIf you feel envious, ventilate your feelings to a friend or write them down. Read one of the ethical works about envy. This will help you realize that envy is a futile and destructive feeling. Before doing anything foolish that may be a reaction to your envy, seek the counsel of a friend or mentor. You may avoid making serious mistakes."},{ID:42,parshaId:38,vort:"\"The Torah relates the wars between Moab and the Amorites, and says, Regarding this the poets would say: 'Come to Heshbon \u2013 let it be built and established as the city of Sihon'\u201d (Bamidbar, 21:27)./\r\n\r\nThe word that the Torah uses for \u201cpoet,\u201d moshel, also means \u201cruler.\u201d The word Heshbon is the Hebrew word for \u201caccounting.\u201d The Talmud, therefore, offers this interpretation of the above verse: \u201cThose who rule over themselves can make an accounting, calculating the gains and losses in life: the gain of a mitzvah as opposed to its cost, and the cost of a sin as opposed to its gain\u201d (Bava Basra 78b)./\r\n\r\nMuch of western civilization lives under the influence of \u201cseizing the pleasure of the moment.\u201d The American economy is built upon credit, with people being urged to \u201cbuy now, pay later.\u201d If people would calculate the ultimate cost of credit purchases which may be outrageous, they might delay buying things until they can afford to pay for them.

Their addiction to chemicals has taken every vestige of self-rule from them./\r\n\r\nAvi is one such person. He is an Israeli whose pursuit of the \u201chigh\u201d of drugs led him to a career of crime. His convictions for burglary resulted in eight imprisonments for a total of sixteen of his thirty-four years.

He lived under the tyranny of drug addiction./\r\n\r\nAfter Avi underwent a successful rehabilitation, he once found an envelope with 5,000 shekels. This was ostensibly hefker (ownerless) money, which the finder has a right to keep. It just so happened that Avi knew to whom it belonged, and he returned it. What a turnaround, from burglarizing homes to returning lost money to its owner! Avi had attained self-rule./\r\n\r\nI learned about this incident and congratulated Avi on his great progress. Avi said, \u201cIn the days when I used drugs, I would get a high that lasted for perhaps 20 minutes. When it wore off, I felt worse than ever.

In his dialogue with God, Moshe addresses Him with a strange appellation \u2013 Elokei HaRuchot \u2013 God of Spirits. Two verses later, God tells Moshe to take Yehoshua, a man who has \u201cruach\u201d and appoint him as the leader. The role of ruach is clearly essential in the narrative, but it is unclear exactly what it is and why it is so important./\r\n\r\nDepending on the context, the term ruach can mean several things in Tanach, including wind, breath, spirit, feelings, or will. Rashi understands the term here as a reference to people\u2019s general personality. God is a God of ruach, meaning that the personality of every individual is revealed before Him. He should appoint a leader who will be able to tolerate each person based on his or her own inner makeup. Yehoshua is a man who has ruach, meaning he can conduct himself in a manner that would correspond to every individual./\r\n\r\nRashi\u2019s description of the skills required to lead is striking on two fronts. The first, is the care and concern the leader must have for ALL of his or her followers. Rashi emphasizes the importance of understanding the innumerable differences between each individual and the duty to adapt accordingly. The leader doesn\u2019t just make policy for the masses and let some fall through the cracks. He or she needs to tend to everyone./\r\n\r\nThe second is the seeming parallel to the constructs of social and emotional intelligence. Broadly speaking, emotional intelligence incorporates the ability to read and manage emotions both in the self and others. Social intelligence encompasses verbal and listening skills, a depth of understanding of social situations, and the capacity to insert oneself effectively in those contexts. Rashi\u2019s description of ruach highlights the need to understand the depths of personality of the other and manage the self and others accordingly. Research in educational psychology as well as in industrial and organizational psychology demonstrates how important these skills are for leaders and educators -- but the question becomes, how does one attain these abilities?/\r\n\r\nOne answer is that having this ruach is simply a gift from God. I either have it or I don\u2019t. All I can do is daven and hope that Hashem grants me these abilities. In fact, we find precedent for such a notion when Hashem took some of Moshe\u2019s ruach and placed it upon the elders until they absorbed it (Bemidbar 11:17)./\r\n\r\nHowever, the Alshich points out, this is not the same procedure that happens with Yehoshua. Yehoshua apparently already had these traits so he did not need a Divine intervention to provide them. That\u2019s why, according to Abarbanel, God tells Moshe in reference to Yehoshua: \u201ckach lecha\u201d \u2013 you take \u2013 as if to say, don\u2019t turn to me to appoint him and make him ready for leadership. Yehoshua already has the skills because he spent years observing Moshe\u2019s behavior and modeling his own behavior accordingly./\r\n\r\nMost of us in some form or another, whether at home, work, or school, take on a position of a leader. We learn from this narrative that we need to be a person of ruach \u2013 to care and tend to everyone we are guiding, and to attempt to understand their inner psychology using our emotional and social intelligence and deal with each one accordingly. The good news is that this is a skill that can be taught and learned, which makes it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources if we want to develop into more effective leaders."},{ID:45,parshaId:41,vort:"Having conquered Transjordan en route to Canaan, the tribes of Gad and Reuben approached Moses. \u201cThe land that God smote before the assembly of Israel it is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock... let this land be given to your servants as a heritage; do not bring us across the Jordan\u201d (Deut. 32:4-5)./\r\n\r\nAlthough the tribes of Gad and Reuben were foremost in the battle for Canaan, they were nevertheless guilty of rejecting their portion in Canaan in favor of the rich grazing lands in Transjordan. When the Jews were driven from the Holy Land, the tribes of Gad and Reuben were the first to be exiled. The Midrash states that this was because they had chosen Transjordan over Canaan (Bamidbar Rabbah 22)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Aharon Kotler states that the intentions of the two tribes may have seemed commendable. With abundant grazing land for their livestock, they would not have to work as hard as farmers, and they would have more time to devote to Torah study. However, the fact was that this was not their true motivation. Their decision was induced by the wealth that Transjordan would bring them, and for this they abdicated the additional mitzvot that prevailed in Canaan: bikkurim (the offering of the first fruits), the Omer, the offering of the loaves on Shavuot. And the result? Not only did they forfeit the mitzvot, but they were also the first to lose their land./\r\n\r\nThe accounts in the Torah are intended for teaching and guidance rather than history. We have so many waking hours which we allot to prayer, Torah study and work. Which of these gets the lion's share? Is it proper that we often make short order of our morning prayers in order to get to the office as early as possible?/\r\n\r\nThere are some traits that are innate, and others that are developed by habit. The acquisitive drive is inborn, and since it may detract us from our spiritual goals, we should seek to attenuate it. Reinforcing the acquisitive drive by habit allows it to dominate our lives. But we should realize that any monetary gain achieved at the cost of neglecting mitzvot is not likely to endure./\r\n\r\nWe would do well to rethink our priorities (Mishnas R' Ahron p. 226)."},{ID:46,parshaId:42,vort:"In narrating the laws of the unintentional killer, the Torah says,\r\nthe assembly shall judge and the assembly shall rescue the (unintentional) killer from the hands of the avenger of blood (Deut. 35:24-25)./\r\n\r\nFrom the phrase \u201cthe assembly shall rescue,\u201d the Talmud derives the law that the court should make every attempt to avoid imposing a death sentence. One Jewish law is remarkable: If the court (of 23 judges) renders a unanimous verdict of guilty, the case is dismissed (Sanhedrin 17a)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Shlomo Kluger explains that there is an ongoing battle between truth and falsehood. Wherever there is truth, there will arise an opposition of falsehood. Therefore, if the majority of the judges find the defendant guilty and a minority dissent, we can assume that the truth is with the majority and that the minority represent falsehood. If, however, there is a unanimous verdict of guilt, it cannot possibly be correct, for if it were a true judgement, falsehood would find some way of making an opposing statement. Therefore, there is reason to assume that a unanimous verdict of guilt is incorrect./\r\n\r\nWhen there are differences of opinion, a person can consider both sides and reach a logical conclusion. Unanimity may deprive a person of critical analysis./\r\n\r\nWe should exert caution when there is a unanimity of opinion. Few things in the world are so clear cut that there is not the slightest dissent."},{ID:47,parshaId:43,vort:"Is courage a trait that we are born with or can it be learned and cultivated?/\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Biswas-Diener, in his book The Courage Quotient, contends based on research and experience that we can increase our levels of courage and he outlines several useful strategies. As one example, at times fear is increased by egocentrism. The more we focus on ourselves and the potential consequences that can befall us, the more we tend to be afraid. Consequently, one potential intervention to decrease fear is to promote an outward focus, rather than an inner one. The more we remove ourselves from the situation, the more potential courage we can feel./\r\n\r\nThe first topic Moses elucidates as he commences his farewell address to the Children of Israel is the laws pertaining to judges. The main thesis of the guidelines he presents is that the judges must act to promote justice and prevent corruption. In this context, the verse states, \u201clo taguru mipnei ish, ki hamishpat leilokim hu\u201d \u2013 \u201cdo not \u2018taguru\u2019 before man, for judgement is God\u2019s\u201d (Devarim 1:17). What does the word taguru mean? Rashi presents two interpretations. The first is that the word means fear, so the verse is commanding judges not to fear other people./\r\n\r\nThe second explanation, based on the Talmud (Sanhedrin 6b), is that taguru means to hold back. The example given concerns a student observing his teacher judge a case between a rich and poor person, and the student discerns an argument for the poor person, the student should not withhold his point. Whether he is nervous about his teacher\u2019s response or the rich man\u2019s, he must not suppress his thought. Yet, even if this second explanation of Rashi is correct and the word literally means to hold back, the message of the verse is still about fear. Fear of another human being cannot be a factor when pursuing justice./\r\n\r\nThe commentators differ as to the meaning of the continuation of the verse, \u201cki hamishpat leilokim hu\u201d \u2013 \u201cfor judgement is God\u2019s.\u201d Rashi, based on the Talmud (Sanhedrin 8a) explains that if a judge rules falsely, it becomes an inconvenience for God. Since God is just, He will need to 'work overtime' to figure out a way to return the money to the rightful owner. Ramban, perhaps dissatisfied with that answer, presents a broader theological and moralistic explanation of the verse. The reason why judges cannot let fear pervert justice is because they are standing as representatives of God. They serve as God\u2019s messengers to bring justice into the world, and if they distort the truth, they are derelict in their hallowed duty.\r\n\r\nBoth Rashi and Ramban understand that when the verse says \u201cfor judgement is God\u2019s,\u201d it functions as a reason for why a judge shouldn\u2019t pervert judgement. Don\u2019t fear man, either because you will be inconveniencing God or because you are perverting your mission from God. However, based on the idea from \u201cThe Courage Quotient\u201d quoted above, perhaps we can suggest that the phrase does not function as a reason why judges shouldn\u2019t fear man, but as a strategy as to how they can decrease fear of man. Meaning, the way to decrease fear is to realize that justice belongs to God. If fear of another man is increased by a focus and concern for what harm that person can cause the self, the judges should remove the focus from themselves and direct their attention to the Divine. They should increase their courage by transcending concerns of person and ego and focusing on their Divine mission./\r\n\r\nEven though the verse concerns judges, the message can be applied to each of us. There will be times when we will be confronted by a moral dilemma. When standing up and doing the right thing requires courage. When concern of what others will say or do can lead to fear and inaction. In those moments, may we find the courage by rising above our personal worries and remembering that we too can become emissaries of God\u2019s word and will to bring justice to this world."},{ID:48,parshaId:44,vort:"In my work treating alcoholics, I have found that the greatest success for sustained abstinence from alcohol is through participation in the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of the fundamentals of this program is taking \u201cone day at a time.\u201d The addicted alcoholic cannot conceive never again being able to drink. Inasmuch as he has relied on alcohol to feel good, he sees a lifetime of sobriety as being completely unrealistic. There is no point in even trying to do the impossible./\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is taught a new philosophy, \u201cTake one day at a time. There is nothing that you can do today about tomorrow's drinking, so there is no point in thinking about it. It is not impossible for you to stay sober just for today. That is certainly within your ability. So stay sober today, and when tomorrow comes, you can deal with its challenges then.\u201d/\r\n\r\nOne of my friends would write down each day how many days he had been sober. When he died at age 83, it was found that the night before he had written the number 16,472. He had been sober for 46 years because he took one day at a time./\r\n\r\nThe concept of taking one day at a time was promoted by Alcoholics Anonymous, which originated in the mid 1930's. More than 150 years ago, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (Chasam Sofer) cited the above verse as teaching this concept./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud quotes ben Sira, \u201cDo not agonize about tomorrow's problems, because you have no way of predicting tomorrow\u201d (Sanhedrin 100b). The Chasam Sofer says that this is the way one can vanquish the yetzer hara, the lower self. If a person thinks that he must resist the yetzer hara's temptations throughout his entire lifetime, he might consider it impossible and may give up without trying. Therefore, Chasam Sofer says, think about resisting the yetzer hara only today. That is certainly within everyone's abilities./\r\n\r\nThis is what Moses told the Israelites. \u201cYou can cleave unto God and observe all His mitzvot if you think only about living this day. Don't take on tomorrow's challenges today.\u201d/\r\n\r\nI am indebted to one of my alcoholic patients who called me, citing the verse in the Torah which says that Jacob love Rachel so intensely, that the seven years he had to wait for her seemed to him like just a few days (Genesis 29:20). He noted that some commentaries say that this is contrary to nature. Separation from someone you love makes each day seem endless, rather than the reverse./\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if you look closely at the words in the Torah,\u201d my patient said, \u201cthe answer is obvious. The Torah says that the seven years were yamim achadim, which means single days. Jacob was able to tolerate the long separation because each day he thought, `I only have to deal with today,' and that was doable.\u201d/\r\n\r\nIt is standard operating procedure for people to make \u201cNew Year resolutions,\u201d and it is common knowledge that they invariably fail. The reason is that \u201cI will not smoke this entire year,\u201d or \u201cI will not eat excessively this entire year\u201d is too great an undertaking, and one fails because one cannot conceive of succeeding. The correct thing to do is, as Chasam Sofer says, to tackle only today's problem today. Breaking a resolution down to bite-size pieces makes it feasible to keep./\r\nby Rabbi A.J. Twersky"},{ID:49,parshaId:45,vort:'"You will eat and you will be satisfied, and bless your God for the good Land that He gave you" (Deut. 8:10)./\r\n\r\nIn the blessing after meals, we thank God not only for the food we ate, but also for delivering us from Egypt, for the Promised Land, for His covenant with us, for the Torah, for life and for His kindness./\r\n\r\nIf someone invited you for a meal, you would undoubtedly thank him. However, would you say, \u201cThank you for taking me into your house, for giving me a chair and seating me at the table?\u201d Why, when we thank God for the food He has given us, do we enumerate all these other things?/\r\n\r\nIt is because the comparison to being invited to a meal is not accurate. A better comparison is to someone who was stranded in an arid desert and had not had any food for several days. If a truck comes by and picks him up and the driver gives him some food and water, he will thank him profusely not only for the food and water but also for stopping to pick him up and saving his life./\r\n\r\nThis, says Rabbi Benzion Bruk, is how we should feel toward God. He provides us not only with food, not only with the necessities of life, but also with life itself. We should indeed express our gratitude for all of these./\r\n\r\nOne of the chassidic masters asks, In as much as we should recite a blessing for everything we enjoy in this world, how do we listen to music or enjoy fine art without a blessing?/\r\n\r\nHe suggests that whereas the Talmud did not prescribe a blessing for everything, it is proper that the first time in a day that we recite the blessing "shehakol nihiyeh bidvoro (Who created everything for His glory)," we should have the intention that we wish this blessing to apply to everything for which no specific blessing was designated./\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent suggestion. We should not lose sight of the fact that everything we enjoy is a Divine gift.'},{ID:50,parshaId:46,vort:"\u201cSee, I present before you today a blessing and a curse\u201d (Deut. 11:26).\r\nR Yitzchok Meir of Gur says that God has given a person the wisdom and understanding to be able to distinguish between right and wrong, between a blessing and curse./\r\n\r\nWe have not only the intelligence to make wise decisions but also the ability to do so. Yet, we often see people making unwise decisions that are to their own detriment, and they fail to use these God-given strengths in their own favor./\r\n\r\nThis thought occurs to me when I see intelligent and even scholarly people smoking cigarettes, knowingly poisoning themselves. True, it would require effort and some tolerance of discomfort to break the habit, but certainly one's life is dear enough that one should willingly accept the discomfort in the interest of survival. People who readily accept the discomfort of a surgical procedure to save their lives nonetheless appear unable to do so with regard to discontinuing smoking./\r\n\r\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that one's judgment is distorted by what one would like to believe. The Torah states this very clearly: \u201cA bribe will blind the eyes of the wise\u201d (Deuteronomy 16:19). One's wisdom is ineffective when a bribe has affected one's judgment capacity. A blind person would indeed wish to avoid falling into a pit, but he cannot help himself if he cannot see it./\r\n\r\nThis is true of every unwise decision. Smoking is just one stark example. We are constantly under the influence of biases that impair our judgment.\r\n/\r\nThe blind person cannot make himself sighted, but we do have the ability to overcome the blindness of our biases. We just need to be on the alert and on the defensive, realizing our vulnerability./\r\n\r\nMoses chose his words very deliberately: \u201cSee, I present before you today a blessing and a curse.\u201d See, indeed. You have the ability to overcome the blindness of your biases."},{ID:51,parshaId:47,vort:"How would you rate your driving ability in comparison to everybody else? What about your intelligence? Memory? Popularity? Honesty? Personality?/\r\n\r\nResearch on the better-than-average effect demonstrates that most people rate themselves as being higher than average across a wide-range of skills, intelligence, and personality characteristics (including the ones mentioned in the above questions), even though it is statistically impossible for a majority of people to be above average in any particular area./\r\n\r\nThe theory behind these findings is that most of us have a self-enhancement bias, meaning that we are prone to interpret the world in a way that makes us feel better about ourselves, even if it is not true. We even have a bias that assumes that we are less biased than the average person!/\r\n\r\nWhile discussing related concepts in his book The Happiness Hypothesis, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt uses a metaphor of \u201cthe inner lawyer\u201d to describe these tendencies. It is like we have an attorney inside our heads whose job it is to always defend ourselves against any possibility of fault./\r\n\r\nIn the Jewish spiritual-ethical literature, we are called upon to overcome these biased tendencies as they are detrimental to the trait of humility and disregard the values of truth and honesty. They can also negatively impact our relationship with others and with God./\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this week's Torah portion, Moses outlines a robust system of governance to ensure justice: \u201cYou shall set up judges and law enforcement officials for yourself in all your cities\u2026 and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment\u201d (Deut. 16:18). Some commentators notice a superfluous word in the verse. It could have just stated to set up judges and officials in all your cities, but instead it adds the word \u201clecha\u201d \u2013 for yourself. What added meaning can be deduced from emphasizing that the judges and officials are \u201cfor yourself\u201d?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Moshe Feinstein suggests that the \u201cfor yourself\u201d transforms the message from being one exclusively about governance and community to a personalized message about the inner life of each individual. We are all called on to be our own inner judge, to ensure that our actions are proper. We should also be our own law enforcement official to make sure that we follow through on the proper course of action./\r\n\r\nThe subsequent commands that seem to be speaking directly to judges now apply to all of us personally, when judging ourselves. We should \u201cnot judge unfairly,\u201d \u201cshow favoritism,\u201d or \u201ctake a bribe,\u201d (Deut. 16:19) in the evaluation of our own selves./\r\n\r\nIn a direct reversal of the self-enhancement bias and the above-average effect, Rabbi Feinstein suggests that even if we are in reality a Torah scholar or a righteous person, we should not assume that what we are doing is virtuous. Rather, we should view ourselves as a simple and average person and judge ourselves accordingly./\r\n\r\nOur inner lawyer can be very good at his or her job, effectively justifying our self-enhanced beliefs, defending us against seeing our faults, and making us seem better to ourselves than we are in reality. We are called on to counterbalance the defense attorney with a fair, righteous, and honest judge, who can help us ground our beliefs about ourselves in truth and reality. Doing so will help us stay appropriately self-aware, allowing us to improve and grow, and become more righteous individuals."},{ID:52,parshaId:48,vort:"If a man will have a wayward and rebellious son, who does not hearken to the voice of his father and the voice of his mother .\u2005.\u2005. a glutton and a drunkard (Deut. 21:18-20)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that the capital punishment of the wayward son was never carried out and is a technical impossibility. Why then does the Torah mention it? So that we will be rewarded for studying it (Sanhedrin 71a)./\r\n\r\nIs it logical to have a Jewish law that is a technical impossibility and is there only to be studied in theory? And what is the specific reward for this?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Elyah Lopian addresses this issue. He prefaces with a question. The Talmud says that the wayward son is a youth who steals to satisfy his gluttony and his craving for alcohol. The harsh punishment decreed by the Torah is not for the crime of theft, but because his behavior is certain to progress to the point where he will kill to satisfy his cravings./\r\n\r\nRabbi Lopian says that the Torah relates that when God provided water for Ishmael to prevent him from dying of thirst in the arid desert, the angels protested, \u201cWhy save him? His descendants will kill Jews!\u201d (as we so tragically know). God responded, \u201cI do not judge people by what may transpire in the future.\u201d/\r\n\r\nWhy, then, is the wayward son punished for what he will do in the future?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Lopian answers that every person has freedom of choice in his moral and ethical behavior. Even a profligate sinner may do teshuvah, repentance. However, a youth who steals for food and drink has lost his freedom of choice. His cravings have overwhelmed his freedom of choice, and he is capable of eliminating anything that stands in the way of his gratifying his desires./\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with addiction recognizes the phenomenon Rabbi Lopian describes. An addict essentially loses his freedom of choice and becomes enslaved by his addiction. I have repeatedly heard recovered addicts say, \u201cWhen I needed drugs, I did things that I never thought myself capable of doing.\u201d/\r\n\r\nAny addiction can enslave a person, whether it be to alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or food. It is, therefore, extremely important that we take great precaution not to develop habits that can be destructive./\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for parents to know. It is not uncommon for parents to think that their son's frequent recourse to alcohol is a phase which he will outgrow. It is far more likely that the condition will progress to most serious proportions./\r\n\r\nWhen parents become aware of use of drugs or excessive use of alcohol in a child, it is a mistake to think that asking or ordering him to stop will be effective. He may have lost his freedom of choice. Parents should consult someone with established competence in addiction, and follow the advice they are given./\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the unrelenting course of addiction is a reward we receive from studying this portion of the Torah."},{ID:53,parshaId:49,vort:"Our emotional experience sometimes seems to come out of nowhere. When we try to understand what makes us feel a certain way, we are sometimes left with more questions than answers. Varying theories exist to explain how and why we experience emotions. One such approach, which is gaining popularity in the field, is referred to as the cognitive theory of emotions. In short, emotions are generally based on appraisals and are tied to goals. Positive emotions, such as happiness, derive from an assessment, either consciously or unconsciously, that I am moving towards accomplishing a goal. Negative emotions, such as sadness or regret, are generated when a goal is blocked./\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons presented for why the horrible curses delineated in Parshat Ki Tavo could befall the Children of Israel is \u201cBecause you did not serve the Lord your G-d with joy and with goodness of heart when you had an abundance of all\u201d (Devarim 28:47). Rabbeinu Bechaye and others understand this as highlighting the essential element of joy that should be present when serving God. Being happy while performing mitzvot is a vital and necessary component. This can be understood from a cognitive perspective, as being happy when following the Torah is a signal that our appraisal and goal systems are aligned with God\u2019s commandments./\r\n\r\nYet, there are two strong arguments against such an understanding of the verse. First, as Rabbi Moshe Alshich contends, this doesn\u2019t fit within the broader explanation for the curses that permeates the chapter. The reason given for the curses is that Bnei Yisrael wouldn\u2019t be serving God at all, not that they were serving Him, but just didn\u2019t enjoy the experience. Second, the punishment doesn\u2019t seem to fit the crime. If the Children of Israel are keeping all of the mitzvot, but are just not happy while doing so, does it really make sense to punish them with such harsh curses?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of these questions, Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk understands the verse differently. The verse is not indicating that the punishment will come for not serving God with joy. The punishment will come for not serving God at all. Instead, the verse is explaining how the Children of Israel would devolve to a place where they wouldn\u2019t be serving God, namely, because of the joy and happiness they were experiencing due to their material wealth and abundance of physical good. In a similar twist, the Yehudi HaKadosh of Peshischa also argues that not only would the Children of Israel not serve God at all but they would enjoy not doing so. The fact that they would enjoy a lifestyle not aligned with God demonstrates that their goals and appraisals would be distorted and misplaced./\r\n\r\nCommenting on the joy the Children of Israel experienced while sinning with the golden calf, Rabbi Moshe Alshich argues that it is one thing to violate commandments, but it is much worse to be happy about it. Ideally, he writes, by referencing the aforementioned verse, we should serve God with joy. If we do sin, the proper emotional response should be sadness and regret. Our goal is to serve God, and when we do, we should experience positive emotions. If we fail in our goal, we should feel a healthy amount of negative emotions to motivate us to fix the problem. Someone who is happy when sinning has no chance of repenting./\r\n\r\nAs we continue to traverse the month of Elul and progress towards the High Holy Days, we would do well to reflect on whether our goals are aligned with the Torah\u2019s. If they are, we should experience joy and happiness that we are living a life of Torah and mitzvot. If they are not, we should feel a healthy amount of sadness and regret that should motivate us to try harder and improve our relationship with God."},{ID:54,parshaId:50,vort:"Why is it that music has such a deep effect on us? Sometimes it seems as though music has a direct line to our souls. It affects our mood and our emotions. It can make us laugh or cry. It can make us get up and dance, and it can make us stop and think. It can soothe us, uplift us, and stir us to the depths of our being./\r\n\r\nMusic is unique in that it can go where other external stimuli can't - it can access our innermost thoughts, where logic and speech are no longer able to reach. Alzheimer's sufferers, stroke victims, even coma patients often respond to music in ways they can't even respond to their loved ones./\r\n\r\nThis is especially true when it comes to the shofar. The notes of the shofar affect several parts of the brain in a profound manner. It startles us into alertness and increases activity throughout the brain, propelling us into a heightened state of consciousness that allows us to see things clearly and act resolutely./\r\n\r\nFriends - the mitzvah of shofar on Rosh Hashanah requires active intentionality. It requires not just hearing the sound, but listening to it. Based on the Talmud, the Rambam rules that both the one who is blowing the shofar and the one who is listening to the shofar must have in mind that they are fulfilling a specific Torah obligation. But the Rambam goes a step further, emphasising the importance of attuning ourselves to its potent moral and spiritual message./\r\n\r\nHe writes: \"Even though the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah is a decree of the scripture, there is a hint in it which is to say 'awaken those who sleep from your slumber\u2026 search out your deeds and return in repentance and remember your Creator those who forget the truth in the emptiness of the time\u2026'.\" (Laws of Repentance 3:4)/\r\n\r\nThe shofar is a call to return to our best selves. It goes beyond the physical process of converting air vibrations into nerve impulses and then ordering them in our brain. It's an enriching, potentially life-changing intellectual, emotional and spiritual experience./\r\n\r\nSometimes, we cruise through life on autopilot, not thinking too much about what we say or do, not stretching ourselves to be better. The shofar is our Divine wake-up call. It can arrest our moral and spiritual slumber, jolt us into being present, jumpstart our lives. It can reawaken us to our priorities and purpose, and return us to a path of personal and spiritual growth. The moments of hearing the shofar being sounded in shul on Rosh Hashanah can become a truly deep spiritual experience for us, as we are literally hearing God calling out to us through the sounds of the shofar to become better people, to fulfil our potential./\r\n\r\nThe notes of the shofar are particularly specific. Essentially, the pattern is a straight sustained note (a tekiah), followed by a broken note (either a shevarim or a teruah), followed by another straight note. What is the significance of these notes? What does this pattern mean?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch connects this sequence to the sounds of the chatzotzrot, the silver trumpets used to direct the movements of the Jewish people in the desert, where we journeyed for forty years after leaving Egypt. The straight blast, the tekiah, was sounded to call people to attention. The broken blast, the teruah, was an indication to the people to break camp - to dismantle their tents and pack their belongings and move on to the next place. This was followed by another straight blast, indicating that the time had come to proceed on their journey./\r\n\r\nIn the context of the shofar, Rabbi Hirsch explains that the first unbroken note, the tekiah, is God calling us to attention - to accept His authority in our lives and prepare to receive His message. The broken notes, the shevarim-teruah, represent breaking camp with our past selves, our entrenched bad habits. This requires doing a deep, honest reassessment of our lives, in terms of the Torah's values and principles, to determine what needs to be reinforced and taken with us on our new journey, and what we need to leave behind. The final straight note, the tekiah, is a call to move forward into the future with our new resolutions and a renewed sense of direction, aligned with God's will and our true, elevated purpose./\r\n\r\nLike our ancestors, we are on a journey in life. And that journey requires a map, a compass. Our Creator has put us on this earth for a particular purpose, and in order to ensure we fulfil it, we need His direction. In the same way the Jewish people in the desert needed to be alerted when to break camp and go forward, we too need that wake-up call to break from the harmful things we are doing, to find new, positive, productive things to do, and to journey forward in a new direction. The map and the compass of our lives is the Torah, but sometimes we forget that, and we need a reminder. The shofar is that reminder. It calls us to take note, to step away from the turbulence of day-to-day life and to hear the crystal clear call of God, the blast of the shofar that pierces our souls. It stops us in our tracks, and calls on us to disengage from all the things that we become attached to, all the extraneous things that are not part of the map of our lives. And it calls us to move forward, into the future, with determination and with conviction./\r\n\r\nThese three steps of the shofar - stopping, assessing, and moving forward - mirror the process of repentance itself, which the Rambam defines as regret for the wrongdoing of the past, disengagement with this wrongdoing in the present, and a resolve not to engage in this wrongdoing in the future./\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that in the blessing recited before the sounding of the shofar, we refer to lishmoa kol shofar - \"hearing the voice of the shofar\". The shofar isn't just a sound, it's a voice. It's a voice with an explicit message, something directly intelligible. We are called on to hear that message, not just in the sense of hearing the notes, but to listen intently and receive it. Listening is foundational in Judaism. The mission statement of the Jewish people is Shema Yisrael - \"Listen O' Israel.\" We recite the Shema every day before we go to bed and when we wake up. We begin and end each day with listening./\r\n\r\nThis Rosh Hashanah, we will hear the sound of the shofar 100 times each day in shul. It is the sound that can awaken us. It is the sound that stirs us to look deep inside ourselves and make changes. It is the sound that opens the door and beckons us to a new, glorious future - to who we were meant to be. And all we need to do is listen."},{ID:55,parshaId:51,vort:'How would you describe Yom Kippur? A solemn day? A day of prayer and supplication? A day of abstinence? The Mishna has a different description. It says Yom Kippur is a day of joy - in fact, one of the two happiest days of the year. This seems surprising to say the least. Yom Kippur is a day spent praying and fasting, and generally putting aside the things that bring us physical enjoyment./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud explains the happiness and joy of the day is because it\'s a day of forgiveness for our misdeeds, the opportunity to begin our lives afresh, free from the mistakes and wrongdoings of the past. It\'s the miraculous opportunity, in a sense, to go back in time and change history\u2026 our history./\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word for repentance is teshuva, which literally means "return". Through teshuva, we return to that pristine state in which there was no distance or disconnect in our relationship with our Creator and with our fellow human beings./\r\n\r\nOf course, it doesn\'t just happen. Real repentance takes heart-rending effort and application. The Rambam, in his Laws of Repentance (Laws of Teshuva, 2:2), defines the process of repentance and sets out its various components: regretting the mistakes of the past, desisting from that wrongdoing in the present, resolving not to return to this course of action in the future, and finally, confession, an explicit verbal admission of all of our misdeeds./\r\n\r\nThe process of teshuva leads to forgiveness at any time in the year, but it has special power on Yom Kippur. As the Rambam writes: "Yom Kippur is a time of teshuva for every individual and for the multitudes, and it is the climax of forgiveness\u2026 therefore everyone is obligated to do teshuva and to confess on Yom Kippur." (Laws of Teshuva, 2:7). On Yom Kippur, the force of Divine forgiveness is at its apex, and our heartfelt pleas for forgiveness are both more potent and more readily accepted./\r\n\r\nThe Rambam points out that the process of teshuva described above is sufficient when it comes to misdeeds that have damaged our relationship with God, but words and actions that cause harm to other people require an extra step. To rectify the harm done to others, we need to personally ask their forgiveness, as well as make any monetary restitution if we have caused them financial loss. Indeed, the Rambam says, based on the Talmud, that Yom Kippur does not atone for sins between one person and another unless that personal forgiveness has been granted. It is for this reason that, in the days leading up to Yom Kippur, it is customary to ask for forgiveness from whoever one may have wronged in the past year, so as to be able to access the gift of Divine forgiveness on Yom Kippur. The Rambam writes that it\'s important for the person who has been wronged to act with compassion and graciously grant forgiveness. In this way, the relationships that have been damaged by our wrongdoing can be fully restored./\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that the redemptive, purifying powers of Yom Kippur can only be accessed through real action and sincere intention - through a deep and meaningful teshuva process. This also explains why an important part of our Yom Kippur prayers is devoted to viduy - "confession". In each of the Yom Kippur Amidahs, there is a section devoted to confession. The fact that the confessions formula is embedded in the most intimate and personal of our prayers - the Amidah - indicates that our confession is meant to be a direct encounter with God, a moment of truth as we stand before our Creator, our defences down, without any pretensions of innocence./\r\n\r\nThe relationship between confession and the other components of the teshuva process is important to understand. The teshuva process is largely an internal process of transformation, buried in the heart and mind and soul of a person. Regret for the past and resolve for the future are a state of mind. It is the process of confession that gives verbal expression to the deep internal psychological and emotional process of personal change and repentance. The words of the viduy help us articulate and concretise the deep feelings of regret for the past and resolve for the future. By vocalising our misdeeds, we reinforce - and give shape and form to - the processes taking place deep beneath the surface./\r\n\r\nUltimately, we cannot just walk into the Yom Kippur experience without preparation. When we recite the various confessions before God on Yom Kippur, we need to have done the necessary spiritual and physical work beforehand. That is why Yom Kippur does not appear in the calendar in isolation. It is part of the Ten Days of Repentance, which begin with Rosh Hashanah and culminate with Yom Kippur. The hard work of teshuva begins, in fact, from the beginning of the month of Elul, the month preceding Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur./\r\n\r\nOne of the confessions we say on Yom Kippur is to acknowledge that sometimes we say a confession without meaning and intention, and this is something we have to be aware of and guard against. To merely mouth the words and assume it\'s an automatic pass to forgiveness and atonement is a critical mistake. Yom Kippur is the happiest day of the year because of its powers of forgiveness, atonement and spiritual cleansing - but it is a gift which is accessed through the real work of personal transformation./\r\n\r\nConfession also catalyses another dynamic, and that is self-transcendence. Rav Chaim Friedlander explains the source of most personality faults and wrongdoing in the world is selfishness and self-absorption. Egotism. Our sages call on us to transcend our ego, to concern ourselves with the well-being of others. The Gemara says we will find forgiveness and compassion from God when we are able to be compassionate and forgiving towards others. On a simple level, the Gemara is saying God deals with us measure for measure. If we show understanding, forgiveness and compassion to others, then He will do the same for us in return. But Rav Friedlander says it goes deeper. The capacity to show understanding, forgiveness and compassion to other people is derived from a capacity to transcend our ego. This self-transcendence imbues us with a holiness and purity and greatness, and it is this that brings about the Divine forgiveness./\r\n\r\nSo Yom Kippur is a day of achieving self-transcendence. We do so through our confessions, where we take a step back from our ego and look at ourselves objectively, acknowledging where we have made mistakes and where we can improve and how we can become better people. Doing so verbally and sincerely before God is a very powerful act of self-transcendence./\r\n\r\nThe other dimension of self-transcendence on Yom Kippur is to transcend the physical world by not partaking in food and drink, not wearing leather shoes, not washing or anointing with oils, or engaging in marital relations. That, too, is an act of transcendence - of transcending the pursuit of personal physical gratification that can sometimes weigh us down, and can distract us from the task of self-mastery that the day of Yom Kippur is all about./\r\n\r\nAbove all, Yom Kippur is a day of Divine forgiveness, a day of redemption and liberation from our mistakes and misdeeds. It is, in short, the happiest day of the year.'},{ID:56,parshaId:52,vort:"This week's Torah portion is actually a song that Moses told to the Jewish people. In one of its verses, Moses fortold the future and warned the Jews that they would:/\r\n\r\n\"become fat ... and ... desert God...\" (Deuteronomy, 32:15)/\r\n\r\nA LIFE LESSON/\r\n\r\nWhy does becoming fat - or having material success - lead to deserting God? The answer lies in a powerful human nature reality. This universal truism states that ego and success go hand in hand. When a person has success of any kind it can cause his ego to become instantly inflated./\r\n\r\nLet's walk through a typical cycle. If a person is down on his luck and believes in God, he'll ask Him to make things better. When God turns things around, this person is certainly connected and appreciative to the One who did it./\r\n\r\nOnce someone has success in a particular area of his lives, the Law of Attraction then comes into play. This Law, put simply, is that you will attract more of what you already have. So, when someone is successful it almost inevitably \"attracts\" and leads to more success. Success does beget success. This Law is at work in countless different areas of your life./\r\n\r\nAnd when the Law of Attraction kicks in, something fascinating happens: A person's ego springs into action. When the initial success that God gave to a person attracts more success, this person has a natural tendency to believe that it was he - not God - who got him the increased amount of success. His thinking - either consciously or sub-consciously - is that while God got him out of the starting gate, it was he who took the ball and made the most of the initial success./\r\n\r\nWhile this might be true, there's one key and crucial element missing in the thought process. Yes, you did work hard and you did make the most of the opportunities you had BUT it was God that allowed the success to come to you./\r\n\r\nThis last part is counter-intuitive and it's the exact thing that God is warning us against. Most people can see God's hand in their lives when they \"catch a break\" and something quickly changes and goes their way. But when they begin to ride their new found success to higher levels, they completely believe that it was their effort making the results happen./\r\n\r\nWhile a person must put forth effort, it's only because of God's desire as to whether or not he'll be successful. (An even more enlightened person takes this one step further and understands that even a person's own effort was made possible only because God allowed him to have the desire, strength, and ability to put forth this effort.)/\r\n\r\nWhen you live with the truism that God controls everything, it becomes incredibly liberating. This is because if you put forth the effort and don't get the \"success\" you desired it was only because God knows that at this point it's the perfect and precise outcome that's tailor-made for you./\r\n\r\nJust as you don't beat yourself up over the color of your eyes, the time the sun sets, or the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, so too, you don't beat yourself up if you don't succeed in a particular endeavor. Put in the necessary effort and then see what God thinks is best. (Therefore, those who live with this reality understand just how silly it is ever to lie, cheat, or steal in business.)/\r\n\r\nGod wants you to be successful and He very much wants you to use your talent and brains to become even more successful. He just also wants you never to look back and realize that you \"became fat ... and ... deserted God.\"/\r\n\r\nStart off this brand new year knowing Who's really filling in all the numbers on your check - and know that He wants to make it huge."},{ID:57,parshaId:53,vort:"In this week's Torah portion - the very last one in the Torah - the Torah says that not only was Moses 120 years old when he died, but also:/\r\n\r\n\"...his vigor has not been diminished.\" (Deuteronomy 34:7)/\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIFE LESSON/\r\n\r\nMoses certainly lived a very long life. But in mentioning how Moses felt when he died - that his vigor had not been diminished - the Torah teaches us something just as important as the number of years a person lives. And that is how he lived these years. The happiness and contentment someone has during these years are just as important as the length of them. A person's age when he dies - while quantitative - isn't the sole measure of how a person lived. Rather, it's his years he lived plus his vigor and passion he had while living those years./\r\n\r\nPeople will disagree on many things. But there's one thing that universally everyone agrees on: we all want happiness. While we might have different vehicles we use to get happiness, nonetheless we all want the exact same thing. And right here, in the last Torah portion, God is telling us that the secret to true happiness is looking how Moses lived his life so we can have the same passion and vigor in ours./\r\n\r\nTo understand how Moses had vigor, passion, and happiness, let's first look at a segment of the population that generally don't have it: celebrities. Many people look at Hollywood stars with complete awe and child-like excitement. These famous people have the endless attention and admiration of millions of devoted fans. The obsession is so great that Internet sites are flooded when an Academy Award winner's discarded gum is about to be auctioned off./\r\n\r\nBut some of these very same celebrities commit suicide (either directly or slowly through non-stop destructive behavior) or simply go on to have unhappy, unfulfilling, and empty lives./\r\n\r\nWhy does it seem that fame and fortune has the potential to make people so miserable, especially when most of them have spent most of their lives day-dreaming, praying for, and working towards the very \"success\" they now have?/\r\n\r\nThe answer is found in basic self-esteem math which states that a person can only feel good about himself when he gives selflessly to others. When someone gives to others, he's automatically happy and feel energized about life. But if one takes from others, and essentially did nothing to earn what one is taking, then he will inherently feel like a fraud. It's that simple./\r\n\r\nSome celebrities are miserable is because they're takers. They're constantly being told how good-looking and talented they are. But these traits were given to them by God and they did nothing to earn them./\r\n\r\nImagine for a moment that in your hometown it was just announced that this coming Sunday, Main Street will be closed for a huge parade complete with massive floats and a marching band. And the reason for this unbelievable gala event is because of only one reason: The town wants to honor you! The police barricading the streets, the politicians in attendance, the news media carrying it live ... the entire event is taking place for all of the great and amazing things you've done for your state and country. This Sunday is going to be your day! There's one small detail, however, that's known only by you. And that is, they actually have you confused with someone else. The accolades being showered onto you are for things you never did. How would you feel as you waved to all of your admirers from atop the lead float? Probably like a complete and total fraud. Outwardly, you'll play the part; but inwardly you'd feel like a fool./\r\n\r\nCelebrities cannot walk down a street without being mobbed by countless fans who will do most anything to get within a few feet of their heroes. But what specifically did they do to earn this inexplicable admiration?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah teaches us that \"The reward is in proportion to the exertion\" (Ethics of the Fathers, 5.26). If someone exerts little effort for something but then revels in the lavish praise he receives from it, it can lead to low self-esteem and a sense of emptiness./\r\n\r\nThe surest and most direct path to happiness, fulfillment, vigor, and passion is to give selflessly for others and not take credit for anything you haven't earned yourself. This epitomizes exactly how Moses lives his life. While there are certainly many activities a person could engage in that will bring them pleasure, many of these experiences are as fleeting as a good night's rest. But giving selflessly permanently elevates your soul and therefore will provide you with an eternal \"happy feeling\" that you cannot lose./\r\n\r\nThis is the surefire way always to feel great and never to have your vigor be diminished. Whether you're a celebrity, businessman, or homemaker, take the unique gifts that God gave you and use them to give selflessly to others. It will make you feel like a real movie star."}],S=[{ID:1,parshaId:1,vort:"\"Rebbe Yitzchak said, '[God] need only have begun the Torah from 'This month shall be to you\" which is the first Commandment which Israel was commanded. For what reason did it begin with 'Bereishit'?... So that if the nations of the world will say to Israel, 'You are bandits, for you conquered the lands of the seven nations' Israel will say to them, 'The whole earth belongs to the Holy One, Blessed is He; He created it and He gave it to the one found proper in His eyes. By His wish, He gave it to them, and by His wish, He took it from them and gave it to us.'\" {Rashi, Bereishit 1:1}\r\n\r\nRashi opens his monumental commentary on the Torah, quoting Rebbe Yitzchak, who tells us that the Torah should have begun with the first mitzvah of sanctifying the new moon, and it only opened with the story of Creation and the subsequent events in order to teach us that the Jewish people have a God-given right to the land of Israel. The commentators ask why this point is so significant to the extent that the order of the Torah is drastically changed because of it.\r\n\r\nThe Levush Haorah answers that if it is true that the Jewish people stole the land of Eretz Yisrael then the whole Torah is undermined because in the Torah there are mitzvot prohibiting stealing and of encroaching on the property of another person {hasagat gevul}. Accordingly, the nations of the world will say that the Jews who claim to follow the Torah do not keep to its commands because they stole the land from the Seven Canaanite nations. And if the Jewish people will answer that God allowed them to steal it from the nations, then that is even more problematic as it demonstrates that even God Himself, does not, so to speak, observe His own commandments such as 'do to not steal' and hasagat gevul. This would cause a great Chillul Hashem {desecration of God's name} and undermine the whole message of the Torah.\r\n\r\nRebbe Yitzchak explains that the Torah addresses this argument, saying that there is no thievery here at all as God created the whole world and He determines who owns which land; It was His will that the nations have it at first, and it was His decision to take it from them and give it to the Jewish people.\r\n\r\nThe Levush Haorah teaches us a fundamental lesson with this explanation; Chillul HaShem is so serious that it is necessary to alter the nature of the Torah in order to avoid this possibility. This is because the whole purpose of Creation is Kiddush HaShem, the sanctification of God's name, the antithesis of Chillul HaShem. This is expressed in Pirkei Avos: \"Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He only created for His honor.\" The Mishna is teaching us the purpose in our lives should be to elevate God in the eyes of the world. The exact opposite of this is Chillul HaShem - acting in such a way that causes people to see the Torah or the Creator in a negative light, That is why it is so important that the Torah immediately assert the God-given right of the Jewish people to own Eretz Yisrael. Thus the Torah begins with a vital message for all of us - just like God is extremely careful to be seen to be consistent with His Torah, so too we must be careful that our actions also be consistent with the mitzvot of the Torah."},{ID:2,parshaId:2,vort:'This week\'s Torah portion opens with the following statement: "Noah was an ISH {man} TZADDIK {righteous person} TAMIM {who was completely righteous}" (Genesis 6:9). The word ISH is a compliment in its own right, and the additional descriptions heap honor upon honor on Noah. No other personality is described with so many consecutive praises in one verse!\r\n\r\nThe first verse in the Book of Psalms teaches: "Fortunate is the man {ISH} who has not gone in the counsel of the wicked, and has not stood in the path of sinners, and has not sat in the company of scoffers." The Midrash Socher Tov, in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, comments that the phrase "Fortunate is the man {ISH}," refers to Noah, since Noah is called ISH, as in our Parsha.\r\n\r\nWhy is Noah described as "fortunate"? According to the Midrash, Noah was fortunate in that he did not follow the ways of the three categories of people {wicked, sinners, scoffers} cited in Psalms. These three negative categories correspond to the three generations that arose in the world over the course of Noah\'s lifetime: the generation of Enosh {Adam\'s grandson, who initiated the practice of idolatry}; the generation of the Flood {immersed in immoral behavior}; and the generation of the dispersion {who built the Tower of Babel in order to wage war against God}. It was Noah\'s good fortune that he did not go in the path of any of these three generations.\r\n\r\nThe Midrash teaches us that Noah spent his entire life surrounded by evil and wickedness, yet he managed to make himself into one of the most righteous people who ever lived. This is a remarkable feat. How is it possible for a person to maintain such a high level of spirituality while surrounded by an environment of depravity and corruption?\r\n\r\nA passage from the Talmud will help us resolve this question. Ben Zoma says, "Who is a wise person? One who learns from everyone" {Avot 4:1}. This is a strange statement. It seems reasonable for us to want to learn from righteous people - but what is wise about learning from the wicked?\r\n\r\nThe Berditchiver Rebbe remarks that righteous people are able to perceive positive qualities in even the most negative situations. From everything they encounter, they learn how to serve God better.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a righteous person were to witness someone passionately engaged in sinning, he would recognize and appreciate the tremendous motivating power of passion. However, instead of taking that power and using it to accomplish negative goals, the righteous person would redirect it for a meaningful purpose. The correct channeling of passion has the potential to change rote, sterile performance of God\'s mitzvot into mitzvah observance driven by enthusiasm and fire! {Kedushat Levi, end of Parshat Bereishit}\r\n\r\nNoah epitomized this ability to channel negative forces toward a higher purpose. A hint to this idea is found in his name. The Torah tells us {Genesis 6:8} that Noah found CHEN {favor} in the eyes of God. The name NOAH {nun-chet}, when reversed, spells CHEN {chet-nun}! Noah found favor in the eyes of God by mastering the art of reversal. He had the ability to redirect every energy from a negative goal to a positive one.\r\n\r\nThis is why a wise person learns from everyone. Instead of being corrupted by his evil generation, Noah used it as an opportunity for spiritual growth. He had the "best" teachers available! All Noah had to do was learn to take their ingenuity, arrogance, passion, jealousy, and zeal, and use them in a productive, constructive way to get closer to God.\r\n\r\nMay we all learn how to transform the power of every energy and drive into positive action in order to become the best we can possibly be.'},{ID:3,parshaId:3,vort:'The Talmud (Taanit 4a) teaches that, although the Jewish people made an improper request, nevertheless, God answered them properly. The Jewish people\'s request is derived from a biblical verse in which the people say, "Let us know and strive to know God like the morning that is found with certainty; may God come down to us like the rain." {Hoshea 6:3}\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, God responds to this request with a more appropriate offer. Since rain is not always desirable, God answers the people based on another verse: "I will be like dew for the Jewish people." {Hoshea 14:6}\r\n\r\nWe see from this dialogue that the people want God to be like rain for them, whereas God suggests acting like dew for them. What is the significance of this give and take? What is the difference between rain and dew?\r\n\r\nThe Shem MiShmuel provides a beautiful explanation of this passage based on the unique qualities of rain and dew. When rain falls on produce in the fields, it completely saturates the earth. Dew, on the other hand, has a gentler influence. Dew provides a light layer of moisture as "encouragement," enabling produce to moisturize itself.\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can understand the give and take in the Talmudic passage we quoted above. When the Jewish people are striving to become more spiritual, they cry out to God: "Make us holy! Make us into everything we can be!" God\'s response to the people redirects their desire for growth. Instead of God acting like rain and saturating the people with externally imposed demands, He offers to act like dew and encourage their own inner process of spiritual development. With dew, God can gently show the people their personal reservoirs of unlimited spiritual strength, thereby enabling them to take themselves to levels they never dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nThe Midrash, which discusses the first verse in this week\'s Parsha, touches on this idea as well {Bereishit Rabba 39:3 on Genesis 12:1}. The Midrash quotes Rabbi Brachya, who finds a reference to Abraham in the verse from Song of Songs {8:8}, "We have a young sister {achot}." This is a strange comment. Why would Abraham be considered a sister? Rabbi Brachya explains that the Hebrew word for sister, achot, can be interpreted to mean she-icha - that he joined and connected all the people of the world.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this refers to Abraham\'s "connecting" all the people of the world to Divine service. At the end of the Midrash, Bar Kapara adds that joining people to God can be compared to one who joins the two sides of a ripped garment. How are we to understand this final comment? How is Abraham\'s joining people to God similar to joining the sides of a ripped garment? And how is the joining of a ripped garment different from joining two separate pieces of cloth that had not been ripped?\r\n\r\nWe can resolve these questions based on the teaching of the Shem MiShmuel that we mentioned earlier. The Midrash does not say explicitly that Abraham joined the people of the world to God; it simply says that he joined all the people of the world together. We could therefore suggest that Abraham facilitated people\'s connection to THEMSELVES, by making them aware of the spark of holiness within them. The first step in achieving our spiritual potential is to recognize that we contain tremendously rich inner resources. Once we are aware of the Divine spark within, we have the ability to access it and to grow to new spiritual heights.\r\n\r\nThe Tifferet Shmuel uses this idea to explain how Abraham was able to convert so many people to monotheism. Abraham\'s genius was in showing people how extraordinary they were already! Through seeing people\'s inner spark of beauty and goodness, Abraham could show them that acting in negative ways was not consistent with their true selves. He could therefore encourage them to return to their pure essence.\r\n\r\nThis explains Bar Kapara\'s metaphor of the ripped garment. Abraham saw that everyone was originally created whole and holy, just as the two sides of the ripped garment were originally one. Abraham was successful at joining together the people of the world because he saw people\'s potential for wholeness so clearly. He could therefore encourage them to connect themselves to who they had been before they were ripped - to return to their true inner selves.\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to drink the dew of success by awakening ourselves to the purity and greatness of our innermost potential!'},{ID:4,parshaId:4,vort:'Parshat Vayeira is an opportunity to learn from the extraordinary actions of our patriarch, Abraham.\r\n\r\nThe Noam Elimelech teaches that the primary aspect of a mitzvah is not its technicalities and details, but rather the love we put into its performance. This does not mean to say that we should disregard the technicalities; on the contrary, we must perform them accurately and to the best of our ability. Nevertheless, when God weighs the two components of a mitzvah, He considers the love we put into its performance to be greater than even the act itself.\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {in Netivot Shalom} cites a proof of this idea. The Talmud {Brachot 6a} wonders what the phrase in Malachi {3:16} means when it states, "u\'l\'choshvei shemo" - "and to those who think about God\'s Name." Rav Ashi explains that a person who intended to perform a mitzvah, yet was prevented from doing so for reasons beyond his control, is nevertheless credited with having performed it. This is because "choshvei shemo" - the person was thinking about His Name.\r\n\r\nIf God is present in our thoughts, and we yearn and desire to fulfill His will, we are credited with performing mitzvot even when the acts themselves did not come to fruition. The desire to fulfill the Divine will is considered the primary element of the mitzvah.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this idea does not hold true in the reverse. The Tikkunei Zohar {Tikkun 10} teaches that a mitzvah performed with all its intricacies and technicalities, yet without love, does not fly upward. This is because the fundamental ingredient - love - is absent.\r\n\r\nOur tradition teaches that God tested Abraham 10 times {Avot 5:3}. Although Abraham had many extraordinary character traits, it was his overwhelming love for God that enabled him to pass his tests. In Isaiah {41:8}, God describes Abraham as "Avraham ohavi" - "Abraham, the one who loves Me." Abraham\'s tremendous love for God enabled him to carry out the Divine will time after time, even in exceptionally challenging situations.\r\n\r\nWe see this idea in the Talmud\'s statement that love breaks all norms {Sanhedrin 105b; see also Bereishit Rabba 55:8}. When a person is truly in love, there is nothing he wouldn\'t do for his beloved.\r\n\r\nAbraham demonstrates this quality in this week\'s Parsha when God commands him to sacrifice his son, Isaac. The Torah tells us that Abraham got up early in the morning to perform God\'s command, even performing menial tasks such as saddling his own donkey and chopping wood for the sacrifice {Genesis 22:3}! Abraham\'s zeal and willingness to perform such tasks himself, instead of appointing one of his many servants to do so, was a manifestation of his incredible love for God.\r\n\r\nThis idea helps us understand why Abraham chopped the wood for the sacrifice as soon as he awoke from his prophecy. A more sensible plan might have been to wait until he and Isaac arrived at Mount Moriah, thereby saving himself three days of schlepping! According to the Noam Elimelech, however, this was not a logistical oversight. Abraham prepared the wood immediately to demonstrate his love for God. When we love someone, we want to do their bidding immediately, with our own two hands, no matter how difficult the task may be. This was the type of relationship that Abraham had with God - a relationship of love that breaks all norms.\r\n\r\nMay we use the inspiration of Abraham to love God, in order to succeed in passing our tests in life. And may we merit to see the reciprocation of that love with the final redemption of our people.'},{ID:5,parshaId:5,vort:"This week's portion begins with the death of our matriarch, Sarah. The Torah tells us {Genesis 23:2} that upon Sarah's passing, Abraham eulogized her and wept. According to our tradition, the letter kaf in the word \"v'livkota\" {\"and he wept over her\"} is written smaller than the other letters in the word. The commentator Kohelet Isaac understands this small kaf as an indication that Abraham cried only a little bit over Sarah's passing.\r\n\r\nWe might find this comment surprising. Surely Abraham was devastated over the loss of his beloved wife. Why would he cry only a little bit?\r\n\r\nThis question becomes even stronger when we look at Rashi's comment {Genesis 23:2} regarding the juxtaposition of the binding of Isaac and the death of Sarah. According to Rashi, when the news reached Sarah that Abraham had brought Isaac as an offering to God, Sarah was so overwhelmed that she died. How can we understand Abraham weeping only minimally in such a situation? Not only did his wife pass on; it seems that, indirectly, his own actions actually killed her!\r\n\r\nA deeper examination of Abraham's motives will help us resolve this troubling question. When Abraham returned from Mount Moriah to find that Sarah had died, he could easily have regretted following God's will. This would have been an understandable reaction; after all, his obedience to God resulted in the death of his beloved wife! Yet Abraham understood the tremendous power of regret to undo the effect of past actions. When repentance is used positively, as part of the teshuva process, it has the ability to erase our misdeeds. But repentance can also erase the reward we receive for performing mitzvot. Had Abraham regretted bringing Isaac as an offering, countless future generations would have lost the ability to draw from the merit of his actions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Abraham cried only a little bit over the passing of his beloved wife to show that, despite the challenges, he did not regret having performed the Divine will. He knew that there are no negative consequences to performing mitzvot wholeheartedly and that his actions could therefore not have been the true cause of Sarah's death. In overcoming this test of faith, Abraham preserved the merit of the binding of Isaac as a powerful spiritual inheritance for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis idea also helps us understand a puzzling passage from the evening prayers. Before reciting the Amidah of the evening Ma'ariv, we beseech God to remove the Satan from before us and from after us {va'haser satan mil'faneinu u'mei'achoreinu}. What does this strange phrasing signify?\r\n\r\nThe Satan is the evil inclination {Yetzer Hara} that challenges our connection to God. The Satan \"before us\" is the Yetzer Hara that tries to prevent us from performing mitzvot and following the Divine will. If the Yetzer Hara does not succeed in convincing us to give up before we've even started, however, it tries again after the fact. This is the Satan \"after us,\" that wants to undo the positive effect of the mitzvot we have performed by causing us to regret our actions. If the Yetzer Hara can make us think we've lost out in some way by doing mitzvot, then we are robbed of the reward for performing them.\r\n\r\nThus, we ask God both for the strength to resist temptation \"before us\" - so that we can carry out His will, as well as for the ability to remain committed to our decisions after the fact and not lose the reward.\r\n\r\nMay we merit to perform all the mitzvot and to be happy with them, knowing with certainty that no negativity or bitterness is caused by our fulfillment of the Divine will. May our wholehearted performance of mitzvot cause us to be blessed with reward - both in this world and the next."},{ID:6,parshaId:6,vort:'In this week\'s Parsha, we are introduced to our patriarch, Jacob, and his twin brother, Esau. Rashi explains {Genesis 25:27} that it was impossible to distinguish between the different natures of the twins while they were still minors, but as soon as they reached the age of 13, their true characteristics emerged: Jacob went off to learn Torah, while Esau went off to corrupt behavior.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that Esau\'s negativity emerged so suddenly - especially since the Talmud {Shabbat 105b} states explicitly that a person\'s inclination toward negativity {Yetzer Hara} does not operate in this fashion. The Yetzer Hara, rather than advocating sudden change, entices us to sin by urging, "Just do this one small thing." The next day, it tries to persuade us to perform another small misdeed - until eventually, a person can be convinced to serve idols.\r\n\r\nSo if the nature of the Yetzer Hara is to gradually wear down our defenses, how could Esau have gone off the Torah path so abruptly the moment he turned 13?\r\n\r\nBased on our Sages\' explanation of the nature of the Yetzer Hara, we must conclude that Esau\'s behavioral shift was in fact a gradual process. We can understand this by looking more carefully at the wording of Rashi\'s comment. Rashi states that when Jacob and Esau were children, it was impossible to DISTINGUISH the difference between them - not that there was no difference! Although Esau\'s external behavior may have been the same as Jacob\'s; nevertheless, something about them was not the same.\r\n\r\nWhat was this difference? We can suggest that Esau was a "big picture" person, who was more concerned with generalities than with details. Although as a child he performed the same mitzvot as Jacob, he disregarded the nuances and subtleties of the commandments. It was this inattention that ultimately led him to reject the Torah path entirely.\r\n\r\nDismissing the importance of details can lead to two primary dangers. First, our Sages advise {Avot 2:1}, "Be as careful with a \'minor\' mitzvah as you are with a \'major\' one, for you do not know the reward for the mitzvot." Who are we to say that what seems like a minor detail is in fact unimportant? Since we do not know the extent of the reward for our actions, it is foolish to disregard details as being unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if we are correct in our assessment, and what seems small to us is in fact small, the cumulative result of a person\'s inattention to detail may eventually result in his performing more serious transgressions. The care and attention we put into performing the details of God\'s commandments can serve as a buffer zone to prevent us from performing more serious misdeeds.\r\n\r\nWe see this idea in Deuteronomy 7:12, which enumerates all the blessings that will come to the Jewish people "if you listen {eikev tishm\'un}" to God. The word "eikev" literally means "heel," as Rashi explains: "If you observe the seemingly insignificant commandments that a person tramples with his heel, then all the blessing will come." If we are careful with the small mitzvot, eventually we will merit all of them. This shows how much we risk losing if we focus only on the big picture and ignore the fine points of mitzvot.\r\n\r\nEsau\'s name hints to his lack of concern with details. Rashi explains {Genesis 25:25} that the name "Esau" comes from the word "asui," meaning "completed." Esau was interested only in the finished, final product, not the details - and this approach led to his eventual rejection of the big picture.\r\n\r\nThe name Yaakov, on the other hand, contains within it the word "eikev" {heel}. Jacob is born holding on to his brother\'s heel, demonstrating his attention to the details that are so easily trampled on and overlooked. For Jacob, the nuances and details of the mitzvot are a top priority. This awareness strengthens his commitment to the framework within which the details belong.\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to serve God in totality, and not miss the trees for the forest {or vice versa}. May we recognize that big things sometimes come in small packages, and create, through our attention to details, a shield of spiritual success and blessing.'},{ID:7,parshaId:7,vort:'Parshat Vayetzei opens with a seemingly straightforward description of Jacob\'s travels: "And Jacob left Beersheva and went toward Haran. And he encountered the place, and he spent the night there, because the sun had set" {Genesis 28:10-11}./\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi explains that this journey symbolizes Jacob\'s departure from the Land of Israel and subsequent travels into exile. Since our tradition teaches that every experience of the patriarchs has repercussions for their descendants, it seems that Jacob\'s travels must still be relevant to our lives today./\r\n\r\nLet\'s examine the opening verses of the parsha in detail:/\r\n\r\n"And Jacob left Beersheva." The Kedushat Levi says that Jacob\'s departure from Israel hints to the spiritual greatness of the Land. He derives this from the word "Beersheva," which is a combination of be\'er and sheva. Be\'er means "well" - a source of water, symbolizing abundance and blessing. Sheva means "seven," alluding to a seven-fold increase of blessing. The Land of Israel is therefore the source of spiritual abundance./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPAIN OF EXILE/\r\n\r\nThe verse continues: "...and he went toward Haran." Jacob understands that his journey out of the Land of Israel will cause his descendants to be exiled in the future. According to the Kedushat Levi, the word "Haran" is related to the phrase "charon af," meaning "anger." God\'s displeasure at the Jewish people\'s future behavior will result in their being exiled from the Land./\r\n\r\nThis knowledge causes Jacob great pain, as the next part of the verse indicates: "And he encountered the place" {vayif\'ga ba-makom}. The word vayifga shares a root with the word lifgo\'ah, which means "to injure." Furthermore, the word makom, beyond its simple meaning of "place," often refers to God Himself, the foundation of the world {Bereishit Raba 68:9}./\r\n\r\nWe can understand from these words that Jacob did not only feel the people\'s pain at being exiled, but he also felt God\'s pain at being compelled to exile His children./\r\n\r\nJacob was highly sensitive to the pain of exile. Therefore, the verse continues, "...and he spent the night there, because the sun had set." The exile is compared to night. Jacob saw that his journeys out of Israel would eventually lead to the darkness of exile descending upon the Jewish people. Just as Jacob slept, the people, too, would be compelled to "sleep."/\r\n\r\nJacob understood that his actions were only a prelude to what would happen to his descendants. Based on this idea, we can suggest a deeper understanding of the words, "And Jacob left" {vayeitzei Yaakov}. Jacob "came out of himself" by allowing himself to feel the pain of the Jewish exile. He broadened his focus, shifting his attention away from himself and making room for others. This teaches us a valuable lesson about the importance of feeling other people\'s pain./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSECRET SIGNS/\r\n\r\nWe see another demonstration of this quality in Genesis 15:13, when God tells Abraham that the Jewish people will be enslaved to a foreign nation for 400 years. We know from other sources, however, that the Jewish people served in Egypt for only 210 years {Rashi on Genesis 42:2}. How can we reconcile this contradiction?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kedushat Levi, as soon as Abraham was informed about the future Egyptian exile, he felt the pain that the Jewish people would experience there. His pain was so acute that God subtracted 190 years from the original decree!/\r\n\r\nThis ability to feel the pain of others also helps us to see why Rachel was the ideal wife for Jacob. Jacob had arranged to marry Rachel, yet he suspected that his future father-in-law Laban would try to deceive him in some way. He and Rachel therefore agreed upon secret signs that would enable them to recognize each others\' true identity. When Rachel learned of Laban\'s plan to give her sister Leah to Jacob instead, she taught Leah these secret signs - because she was so sensitive to the pain that Leah would experience were she to be publicly humiliated under the chuppah {Talmud - Megilla 13}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nRETURN TO THE LAND/\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jacob feels the pain of the Jewish people\'s exile and goes to sleep in the darkness, God blesses him with the promise, "Behold, I am with you, and I will guard you wherever you go, and I will return you to this Land" {Genesis 28:13-15}. We can learn from this blessing the tremendous power of developing sensitivity to others. Although God\'s Presence is with us even in the exile, feeling other people\'s pain can give us the merit to return to the Land of Israel. The blessing that Jacob receives is a message to us as well./\r\n\r\nMay we all learn to become sensitive and responsive to the pain of others, and may this ability bring us one step closer to the final redemption, when we will be gathered from exile and return to our land in peace.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:8,parshaId:8,vort:'In this week\'s parsha, Jacob journeys homeward after a 22-year absence, and meets his brother, Esau, on the way. Jacob prepares himself for the potentially dangerous encounter in three ways: he prays to God; he divides his family into two camps {a protective measure in case of battle}; and he sends gifts ahead to his brother./\r\n\r\nOur mystical tradition teaches that Esau is the personification of the yetzer hara {inclination toward negativity} in this world. Therefore, on a deeper level, Jacob is not only preparing himself to meet Esau, but is readying himself to battle the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nJacob pleads to God, "Please save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau" {Genesis 32:12}. Why does Jacob use this repetitive language? He has only one brother, and there is only one Esau. Either description would have been sufficient on its own!/\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi and the Ben Ish Chai both understand this seeming redundancy as a hint to two different approaches of the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nOne approach of the yetzer hara is to attack us outright, and to try to actively prevent us from following God\'s will. This approach is called "Esau" - the overt use of force to keep us from practicing Judaism./\r\n\r\nBut the yetzer hara can also make inroads by causing us to let down our guard. This more subtle approach is what Jacob calls "my brother." At times, nations will not attack us overtly, but will instead try to befriend us. Historically, this approach has the same effect as the use of force. When we become relaxed and comfortable within a non-Jewish environment, the clarity of what God wants from us begins to fade, and we are susceptible to giving up our beliefs./\r\n\r\nThrough this idea, we can see that the verse is not redundant at all. When Jacob asks to be saved "from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau," he is asking for two different types of protection. He requests the strength to resist the temptations of false brotherhood and camaraderie {"my brother"} as well as the ability to protect himself from overt physical attack {"Esau"}./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with clarity and awareness, so that we will not be taken advantage of or swayed - either by force or by false friendship - to compromise our Judaism.'},{ID:9,parshaId:9,vort:'Among the many events in this week\'s parsha is the story of Yehuda\'s daughter-in-law, Tamar, giving birth to twins. The Torah goes into substantial detail about this event {Genesis 38:27-30}:/\r\n\r\nAs Tamar is giving birth, the hand of one twin emerges, and the midwife ties a string around it so she will know which child was born first. This baby then draws back his hand and his brother, Peretz, is born. Only then does Tamar give birth to the baby with the string on his hand, who is named Zerach./\r\n\r\nAll the details about this birth seem unnecessary, especially given that the Torah recounts almost nothing further about Peretz and Zerach. The Torah does not describe the births of Abraham or many other great personalities. What is the relevance of the play-by-play description of the birth of these twins?/\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi provides a metaphorical understanding of this passage that will help us gain deeper insight. The Talmud {Niddah 30b} teaches that every unborn baby has a candle lit at its head, and the baby\'s soul can see from one end of the world to the other. When the baby emerges from its mother\'s womb, an angel taps it on the lips, and the baby forgets all the Torah it learned in the womb./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kedushat Levi, this tap on the lips should be understood not as a punishment, but rather as a Divine gift. This world is filled with temptation, and knowledge is sometimes misused to pursue corrupt goals. At the moment of birth, God takes away all our knowledge so that we will enter this world in a state of purity. The innocence of infancy enables us to begin life with a pure, complete connection to God./\r\n\r\nAs we grow and mature, God creates a barrier {mechitza}, making it more difficult for us to achieve the complete Divine connection that was so natural for us as children. Nevertheless, we can use our mature intelligence to reconnect to God - if we realize that this world is purposeless for its own sake. Our Sages state this idea succinctly: "The more flesh, the more worms" {Avot 2:7}. Pure physicality, devoid of purpose, lacks meaning./\r\n\r\nThis is hinted to in the names Peretz and Zerach: We can choose to use our intelligence to recognize this, and to connect to God by breaking through {paratz} the barrier that our knowledge creates. Once this barrier is broken, God will shine {zarach} a holy light upon us./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nSHINING LIGHT/\r\n\r\nOn a deeper level, this is the lesson that the Torah is conveying to us through the story of the birth of Tamar\'s twins. The paradigm of birth applies to all of us, hinting to our desire to recreate ourselves and grow in positive directions. At the beginning of the passage describing the birth, the Torah tells us, "and he put out his hand" {Genesis 38:28}. This can be understood as God extending His hand - a metaphorical interpretation of the Divine assistance we receive at birth when our knowledge is removed, enabling us to begin life in a state of purity without succumbing to temptation./\r\n\r\nThe next verse, "and he withdrew his hand" {Genesis 38:29}, can be understood as God removing His assistance as we mature, since the barrier of knowledge makes it more difficult to connect to the Divine./\r\n\r\nWhen the Torah states, "And behold! his brother emerged," we have a hint to the birth of a child, coming into the world with the potential to come close to the Divine and to reach a state of "brotherhood," as it were, with God./\r\n\r\nAs we grow up and our knowledge matures, we can make the choice to break {paratz} the intellectual barriers that separates us from God. This makes us worthy of the name Peretz {literally, "breaking"}. When we make this choice, God shines {zorey\'ach} a holy light upon us, as is indicated by the name Zerach {literally, "shining"}./\r\n\r\nThe story of this birth appears in so much detail because it does not refer only to Peretz and Zerach; rather, it hints to the possibilities inherent in every birth. The Torah teaches us that we all have the potential to reconnect to God as we grow and mature./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to use our intellectual capacities to break down all barriers and regain our innate innocence and purity so that God will shine upon us the holy light.'},{ID:10,parshaId:10,vort:'This week\'s parsha always falls out at the Chanukah season. The Talmud {Shabbat 22a} teaches that the Chanukah Menorah should ideally be lit on the left side of the doorway to one\'s home, resulting in the home\'s entrance being surrounded by objects of mitzvah: the Menorah on the left side, and the Mezuzah on the right. The Midrash adds further that a person wearing a Tallit is in the center./\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, we know that the mitzvah of lighting the Menorah involves all three of these elements. The Talmud {Shabbat 21b} introduces Chanukah with the statement "ner ish u\'beito" {"a light, a person, and his home"}. But what is the deeper message of this imagery? What lesson are our Sages trying to convey?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Shabbat 21b} teaches that the mitzvah of kindling Chanukah lights can be performed on three different levels: basic {"mitzvah"}, extra good {"mehadrin"}, and super-deluxe {"mehadrin min ha-mehadrin"}./\r\n\r\nHillel and Shammai disagree regarding the fulfillment of this last, most ideal level. Hillel claims that we should kindle one light on the first night of Chanukah and add one light on each successive night, resulting in eight lights by the end of the festival. His opinion is based on the principle that kedusha {holiness} is only increased, never decreased./\r\n\r\nShammai\'s opinion is the exact opposite. He claims that we should begin Chanukah by kindling eight lights, and then subtract them one by one as the festival progresses. Shammai compares Chanukah to Sukkot, when the number of offerings in the Holy Temple decreased over the course of the holiday./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nPLACE, TIME & SELF/\r\n\r\nShammai\'s connection between Chanukah and Sukkot will help us understand the symbolism of the Menorah on the left, the Mezuzah on the right, and the person wearing a Tallit in the middle./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Sfat Emet, this world is composed of three dimensions to be sanctified and elevated: the dimension of PLACE, the dimension of TIME, and the dimension of SELF. All three of these elements are mentioned in the Talmud and Midrash, hinting that Chanukah affords us with the opportunity to sanctify all three dimensions at once:/\r\n\r\nThe Mezuzah is affixed on the doorpost of a house, representing the sanctification of PLACE. The Menorah, which is used to count the days as Chanukah progresses, represents the sanctification of TIME. The person wearing a Tallit represents the sanctification of SELF./\r\n\r\nBased on Shammai\'s approach, Chanukah can be understood as a culmination of Sukkot, since Sukkot also symbolizes the unity of the three dimensions. The Sukkah represents the dimension of Place; the seven-day duration of the holiday represents the dimension of Time; and the four species symbolize different parts of the human body, corresponding to the dimension of Self. These three dimensions are expressed on Sukkot, and they culminate on Chanukah, when the spiritual potential for unity is once again brought into physical reality./\r\n\r\nMay we all learn to carry the message of Sukkot into our daily lives and to see it manifest in Chanukah. May we succeed in elevating all three dimensions - our homes, ourselves, and every moment of our lives - and may that sanctity and unity create a strong, radiant light to shine through all generations.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:11,parshaId:11,vort:'Joseph\'s behavior teaches us how far we must go not to embarrass others./\r\n\r\nGreetings from the holy city of Jerusalem!/\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers. After Yehuda\'s impassioned plea for Binyamin\'s release, the Torah tells us {Genesis 45:1} that Joseph could not restrain himself any longer. Rashi explains that Joseph could not bear the thought of embarrassing his brothers in front of the Egyptians in the room. The revelation of his true identity would mean revealing that his brothers had sold him, and that this would be intensely humiliating for them. Therefore, Joseph ordered all his Egyptian servants to leave the room, before he stated, "I am Joseph."/\r\n\r\nWe might wonder how Rashi knows that Joseph was primarily concerned with preventing his brothers\' embarrassment. Perhaps he sent out his servants because it would not be proper for a great leader to cry in front of his subordinates. In other words, maybe Joseph was interested only in preventing his OWN embarrassment!/\r\n\r\nThe Iturei Torah counters this claim by pointing out that Joseph, immediately after sending out his servants, raised his voice and cried so loudly that all of Egypt and everyone in Pharaoh\'s palace heard his sobbing {Genesis 45:2}. Clearly, Joseph was not concerned with maintaining his own dignity if this is how he behaved. Therefore, he must have dismissed the Egyptians only in order to prevent his brothers\' public humiliation./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nSTILL CONNECTED/\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s behavior teaches us how far we must go to keep from embarrassing others. Shortly after Joseph breaks down in tears, he tells his brothers, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold down to Egypt" {Genesis 45:4}. The Ohr HaChaim comments that the word "your brother," which seems superfluous in this context, actually conveys an important message. Through the intentional addition of this word, Joseph is telling his family, "Even when you sold me down to Egypt, I was still your brother. Even in the midst of that incredibly challenging time, I still loved you and still felt connected to you."/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Sfat Emet points out that the word asher {"whom"} in this verse can have the connotation of yasher kochacha, an expression that means "congratulations" or "thank you" {literally, "Your strength should be upright"}. We see an example of this definition in Exodus 34:1, when God tells Moses to carve a second set of Tablets like the first ones "that you broke" {asher shibarta}. The Talmud {Shabbat 87a} explains that the word asher here means yasher kochacha - in other words, that Moses deserved congratulations for breaking the first set of Tablets./\r\n\r\nBased on this interpretation, we can understand the word asher in our verse the same way. Joseph tells his brothers, "I am Joseph your brother, whom {asher} you sold down to Egypt." According to the Sfat Emet, Joseph is implying, "I congratulate you for selling me down to Egypt, because it enabled me to support our entire family."/\r\n\r\nInstead of being bitter or angry about his treatment, Joseph sees how the brothers\' actions actually led to great benefit. They should not be condemned for selling him; rather, they should be congratulated!/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nLOVE AND WARMTH/\r\n\r\nImagine how we would feel if we were in Joseph\'s place - how difficult it would be for us to rise above our own hurt and resentment. Yet Joseph goes to great lengths to treat his brothers respectfully. Not only is he concerned with their possible humiliation, sending out his entourage so that no disparaging information will be overheard, but he even thanks his brothers for selling him!/\r\n\r\nWe can learn from here how to approach situations where we feel slighted. Joseph does not allow himself to be dominated by feelings of bitterness about the past. Rather, he emphasizes the positive aspects of the situation, to where he is able to relate to his brothers with true warmth and respect./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to cultivate a warm, loving attitude toward every other person. May we learn to overcome resentments about the way we were treated in the past, rising above our own hurt so we can see the ultimate good in every situation./\r\nJust as Joseph was reunited with his family, which brought about redemption for all of the Jewish people at that time, so may we deserve to see unity and camaraderie among all the Jewish people and our final redemption.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:12,parshaId:12,vort:'In this week\'s portion, Jacob is on his deathbed and tells his children: "Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen at the End of Days" {Genesis 49:1}. However, this information is never disclosed! Instead, Jacob blesses each one of his sons, and no further mention is made of the prophetic vision he promised to reveal./\r\n\r\nAccording to Rashi, the Divine Presence left Jacob as he was about to tell his sons what would happen at the End of Days. Since Jacob was unable to prophesy without Divine assistance, he blessed his children instead. But why would the Divine Presence depart from Jacob precisely at this time?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Naftali of Rupshitz suggests that once Jacob looked into the future, he saw all the pain that the Jewish people would have to endure until the end of time, and this saddened him so much that the Divine Presence left him. The Talmud teaches {Shabbat 30b} that sadness prevents a person from being able to receive prophesy. Therefore, once Jacob was overwhelmed with sorrow for the Jewish people, he no longer had clarity about future events./\r\n\r\nThis teaches us a powerful lesson about what it means to feel the pain of others./\r\nA story told about Rav Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev is instructive. Rav Levi Yitzhak once visited an ill person who was very worried about whether he would receive a place in the World to Come. Upon hearing the man\'s concern, Rav Levi Yitzhak called over some of his students to act as witnesses, whereupon he drew up a document transferring his own portion in the Next World to the ill man. His students signed the document, and a few moments later the man died./\r\n\r\nThe students were shocked by their rabbi\'s behavior, and they asked him why he had acted in such a manner. Rav Levi Yitzhak replied, "To make a Jew who is suffering feel calm and at ease, even for one moment, is worth more than the entire World to Come."/\r\n\r\n{It seems possible that the reward Rav Levi Yitzhak received for this great act of compassion far outweighed the reward that he signed over to the dying man!}/\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nALL THREE WORLDS/\r\n\r\nThese examples show that holy people do not live for themselves; they live for others. We see this in the Torah when it states, "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt" {Genesis 47:28}. The Meshech Chochma explains that Jacob did not merely live in the land of Egypt for his own sake; his "life" was for everyone! His care for others, including the Egyptians, affected the entire world - since, at the time, the whole world depended on Egypt for their food supply. Thus, Jacob\'s complete lack of self-centeredness had a positive impact on the entire world./\r\n\r\nWe see this as well in the verse where Jacob tells Joseph, "I am giving you one shchem MORE THAN YOUR BROTHERS" {Genesis 48:22}. What is the meaning of the word shchem? On a literal level, it means "portion." Rashi understands it to refer to the city of Shchem, which Jacob describes as conquering with his sword and his bow./\r\n\r\nOnkelos, in his Aramaic translation, defines "my sword and my bow" as "my prayer and my requests."/\r\n\r\nAccording to Rebbe Nachman of Breslov {Likutei Maharan}, these prayers had an effect on all three worlds: the lower world {shafel} in which we live; the middle world {kochavim} of outer space and galaxies; and the highest world {malachim}, which is the realm of the angels. The acronym of these three Hebrew words {SH-afel, K-ochavim, M-alachim} spells SHCHEM!/\r\n\r\nThus we see again that Jacob did not live only for himself or his family. He did not pray only on his own behalf, or on behalf of the people and cities in his immediate surroundings. Jacob prayed for the acronym of Shchem - for everyone in all three worlds./\r\n\r\nAs we conclude the Book of Genesis, we should reflect on the lessons it teaches us. Over and over we see an emphasis on empathy for others - shifting the focus away from our individual, self-centered concerns in order to be as sensitive as possible to the needs of others. Our patriarchs and matriarchs exemplify this quality. It is a necessary foundation - a prerequisite that must be integrated into the Jewish national character before we can appreciate the redemption of the Book of Exodus./\r\n\r\nMay we integrate this lesson into our own lives and be blessed to develop unity, camaraderie, and compassion for each other, so that we merit the ultimate redemption, soon in our days.'},{ID:13,parshaId:13,vort:'\r\nThis week, we begin the Book of Exodus. One of the primary events of this week\'s portion is the story of the Burning Bush {Exodus 3:2}. It seems odd that God would choose to appear to Moses in this way. Why was a bush necessary at all? Couldn\'t God have appointed Moses as the redeemer of the Jewish people without a Burning Bush, in the same way that He appeared to the other prophets?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe helps us resolve this question by distinguishing between the two parts of the Burning Bush: {1} the fire on the outside, and {2} the bush on the inside. According to his interpretation, the fire represents all the impurities of the world - in particular, the impurities of Egypt. Fire symbolizes burning passions that can cause one to yield to temptation, and that have the ability to consume any obstacle that stands in their way. The bush, on the other hand, symbolizes the spiritual strength that each of us carries deep within. This inner strength is an eternal core that can never be consumed./\r\n\r\nMoses saw how steeped the Jewish people were in the impurities of Egyptian society. He thought that the people would never be able to rise above their degraded spiritual state because he assumed they were satisfied with their current level. This could have been a tragic misconception. According to the Admor of Kuvrin, the worst thing we can do is to sell ourselves short. Once we convince ourselves that we will never be able to grow beyond our current level, we actually prevent ourselves from achieving our ultimate potential!/\r\n\r\nThis is why God tells Moses, "I have seen {ra\'oh ra\'iti} the affliction of My people in Egypt" {Exodus 3:7}. The Midrash {Shmot Raba 3:2} points out that the verb "to see" appears in two forms in this verse. This double language hints to God\'s penetrating vision - as if God were saying to Moses, "You see with only one pair of eyes, but I see with an additional pair." Before the revelation at the Burning Bush, Moses lacked faith in the Jewish people\u2019s ability to overcome the challenges in their path and grow to greater levels. Moses saw only the fires of impurity on the outside./\r\n\r\nGod, however, saw the people\'s inner spiritual power - a strength that, like the bush, would never be destroyed. Moses needed to experience the Burning Bush in order to develop confidence in the people\'s ability to shed their surface impurity and tap into their powerful spiritual core./\r\n\r\nMay we always be satisfied with our material state of being {as it says in Avot 4:1, "Who is wealthy? One who is happy with his portion"}, but never be satisfied with our spiritual achievements. We should take pleasure in what we have accomplished thus far, but not see our current achievements as indicators of our ultimate potential. And may we have the courage to tap into our deepest inner essence and constantly grow, no matter what fires we may have played with on the outside./'},{ID:14,parshaId:14,vort:"In this week's parsha, God speaks to Moses and tells him to say to the Jewish people:/\r\n\r\n\"I am God, and I will take you out from under the burdens of Egypt; and I will save you from their service; and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great judgments. And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be a God to you...\" {Exodus 6:6-7}/\r\n\r\nThis passage uses four separate expressions of redemption. Surely any one of these expressions alone would have sufficed to convey God's promise to redeem the Jewish people! Why are all four necessary?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Netivot Shalom explains that these four promises are not merely expressions of redemption; rather, they represent four separate redemptions {see also Talmud Yerushalmi, Pesachim 10:1}. These four redemptions can be understood as four stages of redemption that were needed to completely liberate the Jews from Egyptian exile./\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people in Egypt had fallen to the lowest possible spiritual level. The Midrash {Socher Tov on Psalms 114} compares the enslaved Jewish nation to a fetus within the womb of an impure animal, based on the verse, \"...to take for Himself a nation from amidst a nation\" {Deut. 4:34}. The Jewish people were living \"inside\" the Egyptians. Their identity was completely meshed with the corruption and immorality of Egyptian society./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, since the situation was so severe, the first stage of redemption was for the Jews to be taken out from the darkness and impurity of their surrounding culture. Nevertheless, they were still slaves to their inner drive toward negativity {yetzer hara}. The second stage, then, was to be saved from this servitude. The slave mentality cannot be so easily eradicated, however; even after being saved, the Jewish people were still subjugated to the side of negativity. It was this subjugation from which God redeemed the Jews. The final stage of redemption was for God to take the Jews as His nation.\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPROGRESSIVE IDENTITY/\r\n\r\nWhen we look carefully at the progression of these four stages, we see the Jewish people slowly moving away from their Egyptian neighbors and defining their own identity, gradually transforming from Egypt's possession to God's. This process enabled the Jews to grow into themselves and recognize their unique identity as a people./\r\n\r\nThe ten plagues {seven of which are found in this week's parsha} are a concrete example of this process. As the plagues progress, the Jews' separation from the Egyptians becomes increasingly clear. This distancing from other nations is not a blanket condemnation; rather, it entails a rejection of those secular influences that are destructive to spiritual growth or antithetical to Torah values. This process of separation helps crystallize the Jewish people's unique identity./\r\n\r\nThe Ibn Ezra {on Exodus 8:28, citing Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi} notes that the plagues progressed from the bottom up. The first two plagues, blood and frogs, involved water, which flows to the lowest places on earth. The next two plagues, lice and wild beasts, took place on the land - one step higher than water. The following plagues, livestock epidemic and boils, were caused by airborne disease - one step higher than land. The plagues of hail and locusts involved clouds {the locusts formed a cloud of their own!}, representing the highest reaches of the atmosphere. The plague of darkness took place on a level even beyond that, in the celestial realm. And the death of the firstborn affected people's very souls, coming from beyond the furthest galaxies./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Shmot Raba 9:10} explains that during every plague, the Egyptians were stricken, while the Jews were spared. However, the Jews who completely identified themselves with the Egyptians were not saved {Shmot Raba 14:3}. They died during the plague of darkness. Their desire to become like the Egyptians ultimately resulted in their sharing the same fate as their neighbors./\r\n\r\nWe can learn from the process of the Jews' redemption from Egypt how valuable it is for us to maintain a unique identity and not to align ourselves with value systems that are antithetical to Torah. Even the non-Jewish prophet Bilaam recognized this when he described the Jewish people as \"a nation that dwells alone, and is not reckoned among the nations\" {Numbers 23:9}. This quality of separateness, which is so often misunderstood, is actually the source of our strength as a nation. While other nations rise and fall, we are still here to tell the tale. The degree to which we preserve Jewish identity is the degree to which that identity will preserve us./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to succeed in separating ourselves from any philosophy that is counterproductive to spiritual growth, and through building ourselves gradually, may we merit to soon be redeemed from this dark exile."},{ID:15,parshaId:15,vort:'This week\'s Torah reading says:/\r\n\r\n"When your children ask you: \'What is the nature of this service to you?\' you shall say: \'It is the sacrifice of God\'s Passover.\' " {Exodus 12:26}/\r\n\r\nIn the Passover Haggadah, we read about four sons, and we find that the wicked son asks this exact question/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Kli Yakar explains the real question of this wicked child. He is asking, "What is this service lachem {for you}?" In other words, the wicked son thinks that the whole reason we eat the Passover offering is for our own sake. We are doing it because it tastes good, because we enjoy it!/\r\n\r\nWe find a proof for this when God tells Abraham: "Lech lecha m\'artezcha" {Genesis 12:1}, which means "go for yourself from your land." Based on the Midrash, Rashi explains: "Go for your own pleasure." God is promising Abraham wealth, fame, and power. The word "lecha" means "for your benefit and pleasure."/\r\n\r\nSo too, in our case, the word "lachem" {the plural of lecha} means the same thing. The wicked son it asking: "what is this service lachem?" It is for your own enjoyment. He says: "Stop kidding yourselves into thinking that you are doing the will of God. You are really just hiding behind your religiosity as you go about fulfilling your own desires." The wicked son simply cannot understand how it is possible to do things that are pleasurable completely for the sake of Heaven./\r\n\r\nSure, we want to serve God better and improve ourselves. Yet, how can we know if what we are doing is really for God, or because of some ulterior motive? Maybe we do it all for our own sakes. Even when it comes to Torah and mitzvot, maybe we are thinking, "What\'s in it for me?"/\r\n\r\nThis is a serious question which we have to ask ourselves. This is what bothers the wicked son./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLITMUS TEST/\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov offers three pieces of advice to help clarify whether we are really serving God or ourselves:/\r\n\r\nRemove all pleasure./\r\nMeditation./\r\nThe light of God./\r\nTo explain: The Ba\'al Shem Tov first recommends that we imagine that all pleasure has been removed from a mitzvah. In reality, it is a good thing to derive pleasure from mitzvot, but for the purposes of this exercise we should imagine that we have no taste buds and we\'re not getting anything out of eating matzah. Would we still spend the time, effort and money to do this mitzvah? We have to honestly ask ourselves this question. If the answer is "yes," this is an indication that we are indeed doing it completely for God./\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov gives the second piece of advice: We need to ask ourselves whether what we are about to do is really a mitzvah. One should meditate and consider that maybe the opposite of what you are about to do is the really the will of God. It requires patience before we jump to do a mitzvah. Are we really doing it for the sake of God, or for ourselves?/\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov gives us the third piece of advice on how to check our motives. He calls it "the light of God." Sometimes after we have removed all pleasure, and we have done some deep meditation, we still find ourselves in the dark and can\'t decide what to do. At that time we need God to reveal Himself, and light the path for us. God hid His light in the Torah, and that is where we can access it. We have to turn to the Torah, or to those who know the Torah, for guidance./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLESSONS FROM THE PLAGUES/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the Ba\'al Shem Tov\'s three pieces of advice correspond to the three plagues mentioned in this week\'s parsha. The numerical value of the name "Bo" is also three. Three plagues are placed in this week\'s parsha, separate from the other seven, because they correspond to the three pieces of advice, as follows:/\r\n\r\nFirst came the plague of locusts, which removed all pleasure. They ate up all the food in the land. Then came the plague of darkness, which was the perfect opportunity for meditation, for asking oneself, "Am I living by what I want to do, or by what God wants me to do?"/\r\n\r\nThen came the final plague, the Death of the Firstborn. This came in the middle of the night, and in that darkness God revealed himself. He passed over the homes where Jews were eating the Passover lamb, for the sake of Heaven. Those who perished were those who fooled themselves into thinking that they were really doing the will of God, but in reality they were basically serving themselves. The light of God made the truth clear./\r\n\r\nMay we all have the clarity to know the true path, so that we are not fooled by the yetzer hara, who sometimes tries to paint negativity as something spiritual. And may we merit to see the light in the darkness, all the days of our lives.'},{ID:16,parshaId:16,vort:'This week\'s Torah reading tells of the Exodus from Egypt. In his monumental work, Netivot Shalom, the Slonimer Rebbe writes that the Jewish people merited to leave Egypt only because they cultivated within themselves a concept of kedusha {holiness}./\r\n\r\nThis is based on the verse: "And Moses took the bones of Yosef" {Exodus 13:19}. However the word for "bones" - "atzamot" - is very close to another Hebrew word, "atzmuto," which means "his essence." Moses, the leader of the Jewish people, did not only take the bones of Yosef; he also took with him the essence of Yosef./\r\n\r\nWhat is the essence of Yosef? Yosef is identified with yesod {foundation}, which is one of the Ten Sefirot {channels} through which God causes His influence to permeate this world. Each of the sefirot correlates with a part of the body, for example the head, the heart, etc. The sefira of yesod is identified with the reproductive organs./\r\n\r\nThis is the essence of Yosef HaTzaddik, Yosef the righteous one, who withheld himself from engaging in immorality with the wife of Potiphar and anyone else./\r\n\r\nSo Moses took with him not just the bones of Yosef, but also the essence of what Yosef represents - which is kedusha, separateness from immorality. Only in the merit of kedusha are the Jewish people redeemed from Egypt./\r\nThe commandment to be holy is repeated more often throughout the Torah than any other mitzvah. For example, we find in next week\'s parsha {Yitro}: "And you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" {Exodus 19:6}. And in the portion after that {Mishpatim}: "You shall be holy people unto me"{Exodus 22:30}. And we find in parshat Kedoshim: "You shall be holy" {Leviticus 19:2}. Later it says: "Sanctify yourselves and be holy for I am the Lord your God. And you shall keep my laws and do them. I am the Lord who sanctifies you" {Leviticus 20:7-8}./\r\n\r\nThe Zohar {3:190b} points out that the word kedusha is mentioned three times in this latter excerpt. The Slonimer Rebbe says that this teaches us that we have to sanctify all three parts of the human being \u2013 mind, heart and limbs. Through this will come a rectification of the ten sefirot, which are grouped into three categories. The first group - chochmah {wisdom}, bina {understanding} and da\'at {knowledge} - corresponds to the mind. The next three - chesed {kindness}, gevura {strength} and tiferet {beauty} - correlate with the heart. The final four - netzach {eternity}, hod {glory}, yesod {foundation} and malchut {sovereignty} - correlate with the limbs./\r\n\r\nThis sheds light on the verse in Isaiah 6:3: "Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh" - "Holy, holy, holy." We have to sanctify all three parts of the human being: mind, heart and limbs./\r\n\r\nThe verse continues "The Lord of Hosts, the whole world is filled with His glory." What is the significance of the word "melo" {filled}? It means that we have to fulfill the acronym of the word melo. The mem is for the moach {mind}, the lamed is for lev {heart} and the aleph is for eivarim {limbs}. That is why holiness is mentioned three times in parshat Kedoshim and Isaiah./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nFULL SANCTITY/\r\n\r\nAnother significance of the triple repetition is that they represent the three dimensions in which human beings operate: place, time and self. We have to sanctify every place - our homes, our workplaces, etc. We have to sanctify every moment so that it will productive and constructive. And finally, we ourselves need to be holy./\r\n\r\nObviously, being holy is a very central part of being Jewish. So, the Slonimer Rebbe asks, why isn\'t it counted as one of the 613 commandants of the Torah? He answers that holiness is not a specific or technical issue that can be addressed by Jewish Law. Rather, it is what being Jewish is all about. If a person is not holy, he is not just lacking in one particular area, his Judaism is deficient as a whole. Holiness is the true measure of a Jew and any lack in this area is a blemish on one\'s entire being./\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe maintains that just as there is no commandment to "be Jewish," so too "being holy" is so much of the essence, that it cannot be an individual commandment./\r\n\r\nAs the Torah says: "You are a holy nation unto God your God and God has chosen you" {Deut. 14:2}. It is only when we choose to live the lives of a holy people that we merit being the chosen people. Instead of being numbered among the 613 specific commandments, holiness is a "global mitzvah."/\r\n\r\nAccording to the teachings of the Ba\'al Shem Tov on this week\'s parsha, one of the ways we can achieve holiness is by keeping our minds occupied with holy things. Our hearts and limbs generally follow our minds, so we are basically defined by what we think about. When our minds are preoccupied with holy thoughts, then we become holy people. However, if our minds are occupied with unholy thoughts, then our minds and bodies will inevitably follow./\r\n\r\nMay we all think holy, and be holy, and live up to the innate holiness that lies inside us. Just as our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt in the merit of their holiness, so we too should be redeemed from our current exile in the merit of our own efforts to be holy.'},{ID:17,parshaId:17,vort:'This week\'s Torah Portion, Yitro, begins with the verse:/\r\n\r\n"Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law, heard all that God did for Moses and for Israel his people." {Exodus 18:1}./\r\n\r\nAlthough it says that Yitro heard all that God had done, nonetheless the Talmud {Zevachim 116a} says that there were three specific things that Yitro heard which inspired him to come running across the desert to join the Jewish people./\r\n\r\n1.Splitting of the Red Sea./\r\n2.War against Amalek./\r\n3.Giving of the Torah./\r\nWe need to understand why it was specifically these three events which inspired him to come to the camp of Israel./\r\n\r\nFurthermore we must examine this verse, which describes Yitro as "the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law." The first description is a disgrace, referring to his idolatrous past. The second description is one of praise, noting that he is Moses\'s father-in-law. Why do we label Yitro with these two diametrically opposed titles?/\r\n\r\nLet us share an idea based on the "Tiferet Shmuel" {volume 2}. Even if a person achieves the highest of spiritual levels, it is possible for that person to fall to the lowest of places. This is more likely when a person quickly "jumps levels" and takes on too much at one time. When one takes on more than he can handle in terms of spiritual growth, this can backfire. The person can become frustrated and tense to the point where he cracks and falls back down again./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happened to the Jewish people after they crossed the Red Sea. The "Yalkut Reuveni" says that before the Splitting of the Sea, the angels testified to God that the Egyptians are idolaters and the Jews are idolaters as well {Exodus 14:28}. "Why should the Jews be saved and the Egyptians destroyed?" they asked. "Let\'s destroy them both."/\r\n\r\nWe find that before the Splitting of the Red Sea the Jews were just as involved in idolatry as the Egyptians. They had reached the lowest of the lowest levels. However, immediately after the splitting of the Red Sea, they proclaimed: "This is my God and I will glorify him" {Exodus 15:2}. The Midrash {Mechilta} says that even the simplest of Jews saw a vision of God which was even greater than that which the prophet Ezekiel saw. It did not take very long to cross the sea, and in that short span of time the Jewish people went from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high. They jumped from the spiritual depths all the way to the top./\r\n\r\nTherefore we find toward the end of last week\'s portion that during the war against Amalek, the Jewish people ask, "Is God with us or not?" {Exodus 17:7} How could this be? A moment ago they all pointed and said "this is my God." How can these very same people doubt that God is among them and performing all these miracles? How can the Jews, who were such great prophets, also be borderline heretics?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps this happened because they jumped from the lowest to the highest in such a short span of time - something which is not healthy in spiritual growth and can cause a person to fall all the way back down./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLEVELS OF HEARING/\r\n\r\nThere are different levels of hearing. The commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains the greatness in the Jewish people\'s statement, "We will do and we will hear," by noting that the word "we will do" {na\'aseh} comes first {see also Shabbat 88a}. By saying "we will do," the Jewish people expressed their ability to do the will of God even before they were specifically commanded in the mitzvot. They could intuitively "hear" God\'s desires. According to the Ohr Gedaliyahu, this very high level of hearing demonstrated the Jewish people\'s great love for God, in which they were able to anticipate His wishes./\r\n\r\nIn the second, slightly lower level of hearing, we are unable to perceive God\'s desires before He expresses them. Nevertheless, once He articulates His will, we are able to discern the deeper message of the mitzvot. In other words, through each mitzvah itself, we can understand what God wants from us./\r\n\r\nThrough this idea, we can understand why the Jewish people use two different expressions - "we will do" {na\'aseh} and "we will do and we will hear" {na\'aseh v\'nishma}. The first expression {na\'aseh} corresponds to the highest level of hearing. Without hearing explicit instructions, how did the Jews know what to do? It must be that they were able to intuit God\u2019s will even without physically hearing them articulated./\r\n\r\nThe second expression {na\'aseh v\'nishma} corresponds to the second level of hearing, in which we are able to hear, through the mitzvot, what God really wants from us. After acting on what we have been told, we can hear God\'s will./\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe adds that this second level of hearing applies not only to mitzvot, but also to every situation we encounter in life. Each circumstance in which we find ourselves contains custom-tailored lessons for us to learn, if only we are able to hear them. For example, if a mentally unstable person on the street starts yelling at us for no apparent reason, instead of getting angry at him, we can assume that, for some reason, we are intended to hear his words. Perhaps there is some kernel of truth in what he is saying that can teach us a lesson./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nCLIMBING THE LADDER/\r\n\r\nThe giving of the Ten Commandments in this week\'s parsha teaches us that growth has to be slow and deliberate. God did not give us one huge commandment, but rather gave us ten individual commandments. This teaches us that growth comes one step at a time. As the Talmud says {Makkot 23b}, "Rebbi Chananyah ben Akashia says that God wanted to give the Jewish people merit and therefore he increased the Torah and its Commandments."/\r\n\r\nTorah has to be absorbed one step and one mitzvah at a time. The Ten Commandments reflects this by stating each mitzvah one after the other. This is the meaning of Rebbi Chananyah ben Akashia\'s statement. God increased Torah and mitzvot because each is a rung on our spiritual ladder, and the more rungs we have, the safer and easier it is to ascend./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPERMANENT JOURNEY/\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand the significance of the three things that inspired Yitro to come running across the desert. First came the splitting of the sea, where Yitro saw people at the very bottom jumping all the way to the top. Then he heard of the war against Amalek, where the Jewish people questioned God\'s existence. They plunged right back down to being heretics. This was because their process of teshuva moved too fast. Yitro knew that he was also a repentant and he worried that perhaps he too had moved too fast./\r\n\r\nIt therefore says that he heard of the giving of the Torah, which was a gradual process. First God gave the Ten Commandments and then he gave the rest of the laws. He gave the Torah one step at a time, one mitzvah a time. When he saw this, Yitro said "I need to learn how to grow at a slow and steady pace, as opposed to taking everything on all at once and causing myself to rebel."/\r\n\r\nThat is why these three events are singled out. This also helps us understand the answer to the second question of why the Torah refers to Yitro in the opening verse as "the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law." This shows that even though he became the father-in-law of the great Moses, Yitro recognized that deep down inside him remained a piece of idolatrous Midian. He already tasted that, and needed to make sure that his journey from being a priest of Midian to Moses\'s father-in-law was going to be a permanent and meaningful one./\r\n\r\nGod wants us to grow at a pace which is healthy for us and not to take on too much at once and wind up turning our backs on the entire Torah. That is certainly not the will of God. Rather, do it with caution, one step at a time, at a rate which is healthy and productive. That way we can become all we can possibly be.'},{ID:18,parshaId:18,vort:'The Jewish people\u2019s greatness in saying \u201cwe will do and we will understand\u201d when accepting the Torah./\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, the Jewish people make the penultimate statement of their 40-year sojourn in the wilderness: Na\'aseh v\'nishma - "Whatever God has spoken, we will do and we will hear" {Exodus 24:7}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, the Jewish people received three rewards for preceding the word "na\'aseh" {we will do} to the word "nishma" {we will hear}. First of all, 600,000 angels crowned every Jew with two crowns: one for "na\'aseh" and one for "nishma" {Shabbat 88a}./\r\n\r\nSecondly, in response to the statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma," God called the Jewish people "My firstborn child" {Shabbat 89b on Exodus 4:22}. Finally, the Jewish people\'s utterance of "na\'aseh v\'nishma" caused a Heavenly voice to proclaim, "Who revealed this secret of the angels to My children?" {Shabbat 88a}. We see that "preceding action to listening" is an attribute of angels, as the verse says {Psalms 103:20}, "Angels do God\'s word and listen to His voice."/\r\n\r\nThese three rewards given to the Jewish people - two Heavenly crowns, being designated as God\'s firstborn child, and being compared to angels - are extremely lofty. What was so extraordinary about the statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma" that caused us to merit receiving these tremendous rewards?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {based on Me\'or Einayim} shares three approaches in understanding what the Jewish people meant when they declared "na\'aseh v\'nishma." Let us examine these three different ways of understanding./\r\n\r\nThe first approach regards the ups and downs that every person experiences during daily life. We must be aware that truly accepting Torah involves doing the will of God not only when we are feeling confident and secure, but also during difficult and challenging times. This is what the Jewish people meant when they said, "Na\'aseh v\'nishma." Their commitment to following the will of God {"na\'aseh"} preceded their understanding of the Torah\'s laws {"nishma"}./\r\n\r\nFailure to understand even logical laws {many of which are found in Parshat Mishpatim} indicates a time of challenge in our lives. The commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains why this is so. The laws in this week\'s parsha seem logical and rational to us not because they are inherently sensible, but because God created us with an innate sense of right and wrong. Since God created us in this way, we have the ability to come close to God and to align ourselves with His will. When a Torah law seems logical to us, it is a sign that we are on the right path - i.e. close to God and aligned with His way of thinking. When we fail to see the rationale behind laws that we have the potential to understand, it is a sign that our behavior has distanced us from our innate sense of right and wrong. The statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma" is therefore a commitment by the Jewish people to follow the Torah\'s laws even at low times, when the laws do not seem sensible to us./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nPARENTAL LOVE/\r\n\r\nThe second approach is based on the Talmud\'s statement {Yoma 28b} that it is possible to serve God even before being commanded to do so. This determines whether we relate to God as a child to a parent, or as a servant to a master. A child, out of love, will do the parent\'s will without being told. A servant, however, will only perform when commanded by his master. God\'s failure to command us indicates distance, as we see in the Talmud\'s statement {Bava Kama 38a}, "Greater is one who is commanded than one who is not commanded./\r\n\r\nWe can suggest a new approach in understanding this idea by means of a parable. Imagine two families. One family insists that the children finish their homework before suppertime, has set bedtimes for the children, imposes curfews, and has all sorts of other rules and expectations. The second family allows the children to eat whenever they want, to stay out as late as they feel like, and does not impose any limitations or boundaries on the children whatsoever. The first family, with its structure and clear expectations, shows that the children\'s well-being is a top priority. The second family, with its total freedom and permissibility, may actually demonstrate a lack of care for the children. When God commands us, He shows that He cares about our well-being. When He does not command us, it can indicate a distance between us.\r\n\r\nThe Jews\' statement of "na\'aseh v\'nishma" can be understood in light of this idea to mean, "We will do even before we are commanded." Despite the Jewish people\'s not being commanded, which could indicate a distance between them and God, they proclaim their intention to fulfill God\'s will anyway. This commitment demonstrates the eternal love a child has for his parent - the desire to fulfill the parent\'s will even when not specifically asked to do so./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nNATURAL EXPRESSION/\r\n\r\nOur performance of God\'s will even at low points in our lives, and even when we feel distant from Him, enables us to attain the highest level, which is the third approach. The Torah\'s 613 commandments correspond to the 613 parts of the physical body, which in turn correspond to the 613 parts of the soul. Just as our bodies do not need to be taught natural drives {eating, drinking, relieving of waste}, so too should the soul be able to perform the will of God naturally, without being taught. However, the body\'s drives prevent the soul from expressing its full potential. Only when we completely purify and refine the body is the soul able to naturally and automatically perform the will of God./\r\n\r\nWhen the Jewish people declared, "Na\'aseh v\'nishma," they implied, "We can do even before hearing the will of God, because we have purified our bodies to the point where expressing the Divine will comes naturally." This purification takes place only when we are committed to performing the will of God even during the low points in our lives and even when we feel distant from the Divine. If we are able to reach this level, we become like angels, who do not have a body that separates them from naturally expressing the Divine will./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nFIRSTBORN CHILD/\r\n\r\nThese three approaches will help us to appreciate the greatness of the Jewish people\'s statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma," and will show us why the Jewish people deserved the three rewards they received. As we mentioned, the people were given two crowns. This reward corresponds to the first approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the commitment to following the will of God not only during times when we feel confident and positive, but also during the low points in life. These two extremes - the highs and the lows - correspond to the two crowns given to the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nThe second reward was God\'s designating the Jewish people as His "firstborn child." This reward corresponds to the second approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the Jews performing the will of God even when not commanded. Although not being commanded could indicate distance, the Jews\' perseverance despite this possibility demonstrated their investment in building a parent/child relationship with God. God then reciprocated with the second reward: calling the Jews "My firstborn child."/\r\n\r\nFor the third reward, the Jewish people were compared to the angels, who are capable of acting before hearing. This reward corresponds to the third approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the Jewish people being able to purify their bodies to such a degree that their souls could express the Divine will without any obstacle. Automatically performing the will of God is an angelic quality; hence, the Jewish people were rewarded by being compared to angels./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to persevere even during the low times, when we feel far away from God, so that we live to be commanded once again in all the mitzvot that depend on the Temple - a time when serving God will come naturally, and we will deserve to be crowned as God\'s only child.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:19,parshaId:19,vort:'The Torah encompasses the whole./\r\n\r\nThe second verse of this week\'s parsha is:/\r\n\r\n"Take for Me a donation [to build the Sanctuary]." {Exodus 25:2}/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Midrash {Shmot Rabba 33:1}, this clarifies the verse in Proverbs, "For I have given you a good possession, do not forsake My Torah" {Proverbs 4:2}. The Midrash continues by explaining that God told the Jewish people: Do not forsake the possession that I gave you [Torah]. Sometimes, when people go to purchase precious items, a particular item will contain gold but not silver, or silver but not gold. But the possession that I gave you contains not only silver - as it says, "The words of God are pure words, like purified silver" {Psalms 12:7}, but also gold - as it says, "They [words of Torah] are more desirable than gold and greater than the finest gold" {Psalms 19:11}./\r\n\r\nWe might wonder how the Midrash can compare the holiness of the Torah to mere silver and gold, which, after all, are only material items. Doesn\'t the sanctity of Torah far exceed the value of even the most precious physical objects?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains that Torah is all-inclusive. When an object is made up of many parts, we don\'t view the whole object as merely a compilation of its component details; rather, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. For example, a beam of light is made up of many different colors. These different colors can be individually distinguished when light is focused through a prism. But light is not merely a combination of different colors; it is something much greater than that. The general qualities of light cannot be understood from its component colors alone./\r\n\r\nThis example will help us to understand why the Midrash refers to the Torah as "silver AND gold" as opposed to just "silver" or "gold." We can learn from this phrasing that Torah is inclusive of every possible detail. It contains everything. Moreover, on a deeper level, the Zohar {Trumah 161b} teaches that "God looked into the Torah and from there created the world." In other words, every physical manifestation in the world stems from a spiritual source in Torah. Just as Torah contains silver AND gold, so does it contain the essence of every other attribute and object in the physical world./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nGOD IS GOLD/\r\n\r\nThis idea, on a concrete level, means that the silver we are familiar with in the material world is in fact a physical expression of "spiritual silver." This spiritual silver is love of God. We see a hint to this in the Torah when Lavan confronts Yaakov and says, "You have left because you yearned greatly {nichsof nichsafta} for your father\'s home" {Genesis 31:30}. The root of both these words is kesef, which means "silver." The sense of yearning and longing for a beloved person or place is the spiritual side of silver. In essence, our desire to possess physical silver stems from a deep desire to have a loving relationship with God./\r\n\r\nGold, as well, has a spiritual counterpart. Spiritual gold is fear and awe of God. The verse teaches, "Gold comes from the north" {Job 37:22}. "North" can refer to the uppermost part of the body: the head. Inside the head is where wisdom resides, and the verse tells us, "The beginning of wisdom is the awe of God" {Psalms 111:10}. We can learn from this chain of correlations {gold comes from the north, north refers to the mind, the mind is the place of wisdom, wisdom is called awe} that gold is associated with awe of God. Again, our desire to possess physical gold stems from a deep spiritual desire to develop fear and awe of God./\r\n\r\nThe example of the beam of light that the Ohr Gedaliyahu mentioned above is a particularly appropriate description of Torah. The Baal HaTurim notes {Exodus 25:10} that the letters of the Hebrew word for Ark, aron, can be rearranged to spell the word oran, meaning "their light." This is not merely a play on words; the Ark houses the Torah, hinting to us that the Torah itself can be considered light. Furthermore, the letters of aron can also be rearranged to spell the word nora, meaning "awesome" or "overwhelming." The all-inclusiveness of Torah is awe-inspiring, and through its light, we can come to serve God in totality and completion./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\n613 BODY PARTS/\r\n\r\nTorah is not the only vehicle for achieving completion in Divine service. The Mishkan {Tabernacle} that this week\'s parsha discusses in minute detail is also greater than the sum of its parts, and can inspire us to serve God in totality. The Zohar and the Midrash Ne\'elam both state that the 613 parts of the Mishkan directly correlate to the 613 parts of the human body. For example, the Menorah corresponds to the eyes; the Table that held the showbreads corresponds to the mouth; the incense Altar corresponds to the nose, and so on./\r\n\r\nWe would do well to learn the message of the Mishkan and join all 613 parts of ourselves together in order to serve God in totality. Although it is critical to pay attention to guarding our speech, or seeing only good in others, we must not get so absorbed in the details of self-growth that we lose sight of the big picture./\r\n\r\nThis is why the Midrash connects the donation to build the Mishkan and the verse in Proverbs, "Do not forsake My Torah." Both the Mishkan and the Torah are composed of many details, yet both are far more than the sum of their parts. The goal is integration. When all the disparate elements of ourselves join together and form one complete unit, we can serve God in totality.'},{ID:20,parshaId:20,vort:'In this week\'s portion, we find a detailed description of the eight garments worn by the High Priest: the .breastplate/ .apron/ .robe/ .cloak/ .hat/ .sash/ .tzitz {a golden plate worn on the forehead}, and pants {Exodus 28:4, 28:36, 28:42}./ The parsha continues by describing the animal offerings of the Tabernacle./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Arachin 16a} questions the logic behind this juxtaposition. What is the connection between the priestly garments and the animal offerings?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, both bring about atonement. The Talmud elaborates on this idea by listing the symbolism of each garment:/\r\n\r\nThe cloak, reminiscent of Yosef\'s cloak, atones for the crime of murder./\r\n\r\nThe pants, designated to cover nakedness, atone for the crime of immorality./\r\n\r\nThe hat, symbolizing haughtiness, atones for pride./\r\n\r\nThe sash, covering the trunk of the body, atones for illicit thoughts of the heart./\r\n\r\nThe breastplate {"choshen mishpat"} atones for judgments {"mishpat"} that are false or corrupt./\r\n\r\nThe apron atones for idolatry./\r\n\r\nThe robe, with its pleasant-sounding bells at the hem, atones for the negative sound of evil speech {"lashon hara"}./\r\n\r\nThe tzitz atones for brazenness./\r\nThe commentator Kli Yakar explains that these eight types of incorrect behavior can be subdivided into two categories. Idolatry, immorality, murder, and loshon hara are severe crimes in and of themselves, while the remaining behaviors - judicial corruption, pride, immoral thoughts, and brazenness - are generally undesirable traits that cause other sins to be committed./\r\n\r\nYet all this categorization still does not help us resolve the fundamental question: how can the garments of the High Priest atone for the Jewish people?/\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nOCEAN WAVES/\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this issue, we must clarify the mechanism at work. When the Torah promises us benefits for fulfilling mitzvot, it is not describing an automatic process of reward. Wearing the priestly garments with no awareness of their power would cause no effect at all. The Torah teaches us the potential for good that is contained within every mitzvah - but actualizing that potential takes hard work. We must change ourselves for the better, and only then will the circumstances around us change./\r\n\r\nWe see one example of this in the description of the High Priest\'s robe, which atones for the sin of loshon hara. The Torah states {Exodus 28:31} that the robe must be made entirely of techeilet {turquoise}, a color that the Talmud {Menachot 43b} likens to the sea. We can extrapolate from this description that the sea can teach us how to curb our tongues from improper speech. The enormous waves of the ocean come speeding in with great force - yet ultimately they crash at the shore and dissolve. This reminds us of the verse in the Book of Job {38:10-11}, "I have put a bar and doors on it; come to this point {"ad po"} and go no further." The word po {"this point"} is spelled identically to the word peh, which means "mouth." Thus, the Kli Yakar suggests that the turquoise color of the priest\'s robe reminds us of ocean waves, which in turn teach us not to overstep boundaries in our speech./\r\n\r\nWe see this also in the Torah\'s instruction to reinforce the opening of the robe {Exodus 28:32}. The words used in this instruction {"Safah yihiyeh l\'fiv saviv"} can be translated literally as, "There should be lips to your mouth" - meaning that we should use the "bar and doors" we have been given {teeth and lips} to prevent our tongue from bursting out and speaking negative or unnecessary words. Furthermore, the hem of the priestly robe is adorned with small bells {Exodus 28:34} that jingle as the High Priest moves about and performs his service. The bells can be compared to a mouth, with the clapper symbolizing a tongue, serving as an additional caution to watch what we say./\r\n\r\nFinally, at the end of the description of the robe, the Torah states, "And he [the High Priest] will not die" {Exodus 28:35}. Why would the Torah specifically mention this detail in reference to the robe? We can understand this verse based on the midrashic statement that loshon hara kills three people: the speaker, the listener, and the party being spoken about {Devarim Rabba}. If we internalize the lesson of the robe, and withhold ourselves from improper speech, we can save all three parties from death./\r\n\r\nThe example of the robe shows that the lessons of the garments must be brought into reality and used to improve ourselves in order to achieve atonement. Judaism is not just a game, where a given thought or action will magically bring about the desired effect. We must strive to truly internalize the messages of the mitzvot and make them manifest through focused, positive action. Only in this way can we reap the benefits of their potential./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to cultivate this outlook on mitzvot, so that we can develop a complete picture of Torah, combining our knowledge of the details and technicalities with an understanding of the deep opportunity for self-improvement contained within every action.'},{ID:21,parshaId:21,vort:"This week's Torah portion describes the infamous Golden Calf. When Moses prays to God to forgive the Jewish people for this incident, he pleads, \"Blot me out of Your Book\" {Exodus 32:32}. The implication of this statement is that Moses's erasure from the Torah would somehow atone for the Jewish people's sin. We know that Moses was the humblest man who ever lived, which makes this statement seem quite surprising. The Golden Calf was a major offense. How could Moses be so presumptuous to think that removing his name from the Torah could atone for the entire fiasco?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Baal Shem Tov, whenever Moses saw the Jewish people behaving inappropriately, he blamed himself. He assumed that his own failings were the most probable cause of the people's misbehavior. This attitude can be understood on two levels. On a Kabbalistic level, if the leader of a generation makes even a slight mistake, it can cause a ripple effect. A leader's small error in thought, speech or action may result in the people's committing major crimes./\r\n\r\nThe Mekor Mayim Chaim writes that this effect can be compared to a person holding a long piece of string, with the top end between his fingers and the bottom lying on the ground. If the person moves the top of the string even slightly, the bottom will move as well. The top of the string - the \"head\" - symbolizes the head of the generation. Just as the head of the string causes the bottom to move, so too does the head of the generation impact those lower down./\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, we can understand Moses's behavior as covering for the Jewish people. He took responsibility for their mistake because of his intense commitment to leading them. It is as if Moses said, \"Had I been a better leader, they would have been better people.\" He saw their mistake as a reflection on his failure to guide them properly./\r\n\r\nIn fact, this was not the case, as we see in God's subsequent statement, \"The one who really sinned to me I will blot out of My Book\" {Exodus 32:33}. Moses was completely guiltless in this situation. Yet we see that Moses was nevertheless prepared to cover for the people by taking the blame himself./\r\n\r\nNow we can understand Moses's plea to be taken out of the Torah. Moses was not being presumptuous by claiming that his erasure from the Torah would atone for the people's sin; rather, he was begging, \"Punish me instead of them!\" A willingness to cover for other people - deflecting the accusations against them and accepting the blame ourselves - is one of the greatest ways to demonstrate love./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to love each other to the degree where we can point the accusatory finger at ourselves instead of at others. In this way, may we be able to rectify our old mistake of baseless hatred, and replace it with baseless love, that we may merit our full and final redemption."},{ID:22,parshaId:22,vort:"In this week's parsha, Moses tells the Jewish people that God has appointed Betzalel as chief craftsman to build the Tabernacle {Exodus 35:30}. The Talmud {Brachot 55a} explains that Betzalel got this position due to his great wisdom, as follows: Although God initially commanded Moses to build the Tabernacle and only afterwards commanded him to build the Ark, when Moses told Betzalel what to build, he reversed the order of these instructions./\r\n\r\nBetzalel questioned Moses about this order. If the way of the world is to first build a home and only then fill it with furniture, why would it make sense to build the furniture before the structure? Perhaps God had commanded the Tabernacle and the Ark to be built in a different order? Moses saw from this insight that Betzalel was aligned with God's knowledge, and that the name Betzalel {from the words \"b'tzel E-l,\" meaning, \"in the shadow of God\"} was fitting for him./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Shmot Rabba 50:2} has a seemingly contradictory perspective on these events. According to the Midrash, the verse, \"Betzalel made the Ark\" {Exodus 37:1} clarifies the verse in Proverbs {9:9} that states, \"Give to a wise person, and he increases wisdom.\" How is this verse a reference to Betzalel?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that when Moses told Betzalel to build the Tabernacle, Betzalel asked him about the nature of it. Moses replied that the Tabernacle would be a place for the Divine Presence to rest, from which God would teach Torah to the Jewish people. Betzalel inquired where the Torah would be placed. Moses explained that the Tabernacle would be built first, and afterwards the Ark would be crafted, in which to put the Torah. Betzalel replied that this was not honorable to the Torah; therefore, he would make the Ark first./\r\n\r\nThis Midrash seems to blatantly contradict the Talmudic passage we mentioned above. Which structure was built first, the Tabernacle or the Ark, and what were the reasons for that order?/\r\n\r\nThe Shem MiShmuel proposes an insight. In his view, there are two approaches in serving God. The approach that is suitable for most people is to study Torah first, so that eventually the intellectual knowledge we acquire will enable us to correct our undesirable character traits. In other words, we must first fill the mind with an awareness of God, and then infuse that awareness into the limbs of our body to perfect our behavior./\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the second approach is applicable only to an elite few. In this method, we sanctify our behavior first, working to eliminate any character flaws we may have and exerting ourselves to perfect our actions. Only after we have done this do we merit to be filled with Torah./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nMIND AND BODY/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can begin to resolve the contradiction between the order of events in the Talmud and the Midrash. Let us first understand the connection between the two structures we mentioned before {Tabernacle and Ark} and the two elements that the Shem MiShmuel discusses {mind and body}. The Tabernacle, which was built using physical labor and craftsmanship, represents the physical control of the limbs. The Ark, on the other hand, where the Torah is placed, represents the intellectual pursuit of Torah knowledge./\r\n\r\nThe Torah portions of Trumah and Vayakhel both deal with the construction of the Tabernacle. Although Parshat Trumah precedes this week's parsha of Vayakhel in the Torah itself, the commentator Levush HaOra {Exodus 38:22} writes that the events of Parshat Trumah chronologically took place after Parshat Vayakhel. We learn this from the first verse of this week's portion: \"And Moses gathered the people\" {Exodus 35:1}. Rashi states that this gathering took place the day after Yom Kippur, when Moses returned to the people and informed them that they could achieve atonement for the Golden Calf by building of the Tabernacle. This is when Moses mentioned the Tabernacle first and the Ark second. At a later date, in Parshat Trumah, Moses taught the people all the details that the Tabernacle should contain - mentioning the Ark first and the Tabernacle second./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Zohar, Moses was pursued by forces of evil from the time of his youth. He had to exert himself tremendously to refine his actions and behavior. Only after he had perfected his character did he merit to receive the awareness and understanding of Torah. This is why he initially tells the people in Parshat Vayakhel to build the Tabernacle first. The Tabernacle represents physical action and behavioral change - the approach that is appropriate only for an elite few./\r\n\r\nThis approach resonated with Moses, since it is the approach he lived. The Midrash, in which Moses mentions building the Tabernacle first, is therefore referring to the instructions given in Parshat Vayakhel. Betzalel's objection - that it would dishonor the Torah to build the Tabernacle first - implies that there is an alternative method of drawing close to God. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for the people to follow a different pattern./\r\n\r\nApparently, Moses agreed with Betzalel's assessment. In his subsequent address to the people, in Parshat Trumah, he reversed the order of the building instructions, mentioning the Ark first. This is the approach to which the Talmud refers, when Moses tells Betzalel to build the Ark before the Tabernacle. As mentioned, the Ark represents intellectual awareness. The approach where awareness precedes major behavioral refinement is more appropriate for the masses. Betzalel's question here is not merely logical {why would one build the furniture before the house?} but also because Moses's previous instructions were in the reverse order. Why did Moses change the order? Moses sees from this question that Betzalel is truly intent on performing God's will and is therefore fittingly named./\r\n\r\nWe see from here that there is no contradiction between the Talmud and the Midrash. The Talmud is referring to the approach of Parshat Trumah, where the Ark {awareness} comes before the Tabernacle {action}. This approach is the more common one. The Midrash is referring to the approach of Parshat Vayakhel, where the Tabernacle {action} comes before the Ark {awareness} - an approach that is appropriate only for an elite few./\r\n\r\nMay we each merit to find our unique connection to God, and may we soon merit to serve God in totality, with the building of the Ark and the Temple."},{ID:23,parshaId:23,vort:'Moving forward, during the light and the darkness./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s Torah portion concludes the Book of Exodus by describing the construction of the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the priestly garments. The Midrash {Tanchuma 11} states two opinions regarding the seven-day inauguration of the Tabernacle. According to Rebbe Chiya ben Yosef, Moses dissembled and reassembled the Tabernacle twice a day during the inauguration. This is deduced from the repetition of the word "to erect," which appears in the forms "takim" {Exodus 40:2} and "hukam" {Exodus 40:17}. How could the Tabernacle be erected again once it was already built? According to Rebbe Chiya, the repetition of this word implies that Moses took the Tabernacle apart and then rebuilt it./\r\n\r\nRebbe Chanina adds to Rebbe Chiya\'s opinion by noting the word "vayakem" {Exodus 40:18}, which is from the same root word "to erect." Rebbe Chanina therefore claims that Moses dissembled and reassembled the Tabernacle three times a day! By now, the question is obvious: why was it necessary for Moses to continually take apart and rebuild the Tabernacle?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe uses this Midrash to teach us a vital lesson. Although we spend our lives toiling and struggling to build ourselves into sanctuaries - vessels worthy for the Divine Presence to rest within - there still may be times that we stumble and fall. Despite these low periods, however, we must never give up hope. Rather, we must rouse ourselves immediately and continue to strengthen and build ourselves, because it is forbidden for a Jew to fall into despair./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nTWICE A DAY/\r\n\r\nWe see this lesson expressed in Rebbe Chiya ben Yosef\'s opinion that Moses dismantled and rebuilt the Tabernacle twice a day. These two times correspond to morning and evening: the bright time and the dark time of the day. We could suggest that the message being conveyed here is to move forward not only during the bright, easy times of life, but also when circumstances are dark and difficult. No matter what the situation, our task is to build ourselves and continue to grow./\r\n\r\nRebbe Chanina\'s opinion - that Moses rebuilt the Tabernacle three times a day - also hints to this idea. If the Tabernacle was dismantled three times a day for all seven days of the inauguration, then it was taken apart and put back together a total of 21 times. Twenty-one is the numerical value of the word "ehyeh," which means, "I will be." When God revealed Himself to Moses at the Burning Bush, this is the Name that He asked Moses to tell the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nGod\'s description of Himself as "Ehyeh asher ehyeh" - literally, "I will be what I will be" {Exodus 3:14} - can be interpreted to mean, "I will be with a person who says I will be." Even after we stumble and fall, God is with us when we choose to continue on the path of growth rather than sinking into hopelessness./\r\n\r\nThe statement "Ehyeh asher ehyeh" also hints to the value of the word "ehyeh" multiplied by itself, resulting in 441. This is the same numerical value as the word "emet," which means "truth." We can suggest that a person who cultivates an attitude of continual growth, even during difficult times, will eventually come to truth./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to never give up, even after falling two or three or 21 times, by having confidence in ourselves and realizing that the fall is part of the climb. By doing so, may we build ourselves into a sanctuary, and merit to witness the rebuilding of the ultimate sanctuary, our Holy Temple in Jerusalem.'},{ID:24,parshaId:24,vort:'This week\'s Torah portion begins with God speaking to Moses {Leviticus 1:1}. Rashi points out that God addresses Moses with the word "vayikra," whereas in Parshat Balak {Numbers 23:4} God speaks to the gentile prophet, Bilam, with the word "vayikar." Although these two words are almost identical, the word "vayikra" comes from the root word "to call," whereas the word "vayikar" comes from the root word "to happen." What does this difference in terminology signify?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Shem MiShmuel explains that God did not call to Bilam with affection; rather, He simply chanced upon him and happened to speak to him. But the word "vayikar" also has a deeper significance in the story of Bilam. According to the Shem MiShmuel, Bilam\'s experience communicating with the Divine was just something that happened - just another event in his life. Speaking with God did not change Bilam or move him to grow in any way; it simply happened to take place./\r\n\r\nBilam wanted the best of both worlds. He wanted to be close to God, but, at the same time, he was not willing to change any aspect of his lifestyle. Although Bilam claims that he wishes to die the death of the righteous {Numbers 23:10}, it is clear from his conduct that he has no intention of compromising his behavior in order to reach this goal. Yet the point of Torah is to make a difference and spur us to growth. Surface knowledge that doesn\'t make a difference in our lives is almost worthless. The true value of Torah is revealed when we allow it to penetrate, and when we use that wisdom to change our lives./\r\n\r\nAccording to our tradition, the word vayikra is written in a Torah scroll with a small letter aleph. Although the text is ambiguous regarding who exactly called to Moses, this letter makes it quite clear. Aleph is spelled the same way as the word aluf, which means "chief." Furthermore, the letter aleph itself is composed of one long line and two short lines, which resemble a vav and two yuds. The numerical value of these component letters is 26 - the same numerical value as God\'s four-letter Name. Thus, the aleph teaches us that the Chief {aluf} of the World {i.e. God, numerically 26} is ultimately One: the numerical value of the letter aleph./\r\n\r\nWhen we use Torah to grow, we have the opportunity to elevate ourselves and become God-like. It was God who called to Moses, calling to him with love: "Come here! Come close! Grow toward Me!"/\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to hear our calling in life, and may our knowledge penetrate below the surface and make a difference in how we live our lives.'},{ID:25,parshaId:25,vort:"Good leaders know their own limits. They do not try to do it all themselves. They build teams. They create space for people who are strong where they are weak. They understand the importance of checks and balances and the separation of powers. They surround themselves with people who are different from them. They understand the danger of concentrating all power in a single individual. But learning your limits, knowing there are things you cannot do \u2013 even things you cannot be \u2013 can be a painful experience. Sometimes it involves an emotional crisis./\r\n\r\nThe Torah contains four fascinating accounts of such moments. What links them is not words but music. From quite early on in Jewish history, the Torah was sung, not just read. Moses at the end of his life calls the Torah a song.1 Different traditions grew up in Israel and Babylon, and from around the tenth century onward the chant began to be systematised in the form of the musical notations known as ta\u2019amei ha-mikra, cantillation signs, devised by the Tiberian Masoretes {guardians of Judaism\u2019s sacred texts}. One very rare note, known as a shalshelet {chain}, appears in the Torah four times only. Each time it is a sign of existential crisis. Three instances are in the book of Genesis. The fourth is in our parsha. As we will see, the fourth is about leadership. In a broad sense, the other three are as well./\r\n\r\nThe first instance occurs in the story of Lot. Aftet Lot separated from his uncle Abraham he settled in Sodom. There he assimilated into the local population. His daughters married local men. He himself sat in the city gate, a sign that he had been made a Judge. Then two visitors come to tell him to leave, for God is about to destroy the city. Yet Lot hesitates, and above the word for \u201chesitates\u201d \u2013 vayitmamah \u2013 is a shalshelet. {Gen. 19:16}. Lot is torn, conflicted. He senses that the visitors are right. The city is indeed about to be destroyed. But he has invested his whole future in the new identity he has been carving out for himself and his daughters. The angels then forcibly take him out of the city to safety \u2013 had they not done so, he would have delayed until it was too late./\r\n\r\nThe second shalshelet occurs when Abraham asks his servant \u2013 traditionally identified as Eliezer \u2013 to find a wife for Isaac his son. The commentators suggest that Eliezer felt a profound ambivalence about his mission. Were Isaac not to marry and have children, Abraham's estate would eventually pass to Eliezer or his descendants. Abraham had already said so before Isaac was born: \u201cSovereign Lord, what can You give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?\u201d {Gen. 15:2}. If Eliezer succeeded in his mission, bringing back a wife for Isaac, and if the couple had children, then his chances of one day acquiring Abraham\u2019s wealth would disappear completely. Two instincts warred within him: loyalty to Abraham and personal ambition. The verse states: \u201cAnd he said: Lord, the God of my master Abraham, send me\u2026good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham\u201d {Gen. 24:12}. Eliezer\u2019s loyalty to Abraham won, but not without a deep struggle. Hence the shalshelet {Gen. 24:12}./\r\n\r\nThe third shalshalet brings us to Egypt and the life of Joseph. Sold by his brothers as a slave, he is now working in the house of an eminent Egyptian, Potiphar. Left alone in the house with his master\u2019s wife, he finds himself the object of her desire. He is handsome. She wants him to sleep with her. He refuses. To do such a thing, he says, would be to betray his master, her husband. It would be a sin against God. Yet over \u201che refused\u201d is a shalshelet, {Genesis 39:8} indicating \u2013 as some rabbinic sources and mediaeval commentaries suggest \u2013 that he did so at the cost of considerable effort.2 He nearly succumbed. This was more than the usual conflict between sin and temptation. It was a conflict of identity. Recall that Joseph was living in a new and strange land. His brothers had rejected him. They had made it clear that they did not want him as part of their family. Why then should he not, in Egypt, do as the Egyptians do? Why not yield to his master's wife if that is what she wanted? The question for Joseph was not just, \u201cIs this right?\u201d but also, \u201cAm I an Egyptian or a Jew?\u201d/\r\n\r\nAll three episodes are about inner conflict, and all three are about identity. There are times when each of us has to decide, not just \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d but \u201cWhat kind of person shall I be?\u201d That is particularly fateful in the case of a leader, which brings us to episode four, this time with Moses in the central role./\r\n\r\nAfter the sin of the Golden Calf, Moses had, at God\u2019s command instructed the Israelites to build a Sanctuary which would be, in effect, a permanent symbolic home for God in the midst of the people. By now the work is complete and all that remains is for Moses to induct his brother Aaron and Aaron\u2019s sons into office. He robes Aaron with the special garments of the High Priest, anoints him with oil, and performs the various sacrifices appropriate to the occasion. Over the word vayishchat, \u201cand he slaughtered [the sacrificial ram]\u201d {Lev. 8:23} there is a shalshelet. By now we know that this means there was an internal struggle in Moses\u2019 mind. But what was it? There is not the slightest sign in the text that suggests that he was undergoing a crisis./\r\n\r\nYet a moment's thought makes it clear what Moses\u2019 inner turmoil was about. Until now he had led the Jewish people. Aaron had assisted him, accompanying him on his missions to Pharaoh, acting as his spokesman, aide and second-in-command. Now, however, Aaron was about to undertake a new leadership role in his own right. No longer would he be one step behind Moses. He would do what Moses himself could not. He would preside over the daily offerings in the Tabernacle. He would mediate the avodah, the Israelites\u2019 sacred service to God. Once a year on Yom Kippur he would perform the service that would secure atonement for the people from its sins. No longer in Moses\u2019 shadow, Aaron was about to become the one kind of leader Moses was not destined to be: a High Priest./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud adds a further dimension to the poignancy of the moment. At the Burning Bush, Moses had repeatedly resisted God\u2019s call to lead the people. Eventually God told him that Aaron would go with him, helping him speak {Ex. 4:14-16}. The Talmud says that at that moment Moses lost the chance to be a Priest: \u201cOriginally [said God] I had intended that you would be the Priest and Aaron your brother would be a Levite. Now he will be the Priest and you will be a Levite.\u201d3/\r\n\r\nThat is Moses\u2019 inner struggle, conveyed by the shalshelet. He is about to induct his brother into an office he himself will never hold. Things might have been otherwise \u2013 but life is not lived in the world of \u201cmight have been.\u201d He surely feels joy for his brother, but he cannot altogether avoid a sense of loss. Perhaps he already senses what he will later discover, that though he was the prophet and liberator, Aaron will have a privilege Moses will be denied, namely, seeing his children and their descendants inherit his role. The son of a Priest is a Priest. The son of a Prophet is rarely a Prophet./\r\n\r\nWhat all four stories tell us is that there comes a time for each of us when we must make an ultimate decision as to who we are. It is a moment of existential truth. Lot is a Hebrew, not a citizen of Sodom. Eliezer is Abraham\u2019s servant, not his heir. Joseph is Jacob\u2019s son, not an Egyptian of loose morals. Moses is a Prophet, not a Priest. To say \u2018Yes\u2019 to who we are, we have to have the courage to say \u2018No\u2019 to who we are not. Pain and struggle is always involved in this type of conflict. That is the meaning of the shalshelet. But we emerge less conflicted than we were before./\r\n\r\nThis applies especially to leaders, which is why the case of Moses in our parsha is so important. There were things Moses was not destined to do. He would never become a Priest. That task fell to Aaron. He would never lead the people across the Jordan. That was Joshua\u2019s role. Moses had to accept both facts with good grace if he was to be honest with himself. And great leaders must be honest with themselves if they are to be honest with those they lead./\r\n\r\nA leader should never try to be all things to all people. A leader should be content to be who they are. Leaders must have the strength to know what they cannot be if they are to have the courage to be truly their best selves."},{ID:26,parshaId:26,vort:"This week's Torah portion contains the dramatic story of Nadav and Avihu, two of Aaron's sons, who bring a strange offering to God. This is so unacceptable that a fire consumes them on the spot and they die. The Midrash {Yalkut Shimoni 524} suggests seven reasons why Aaron's sons might have deserved death:/\r\n\r\nNadav and Avihu were impatient for Moses and Aaron to die so that they could take over leadership of the Jewish people./\r\n1. They made Jewish legal decisions in front of Moses, their rabbi, a sign of disrespect./\r\n2. They entered the holy area while intoxicated./\r\n3. They entered the holy area without first washing their hands and feet./\r\n4. They entered the holy area without wearing the priestly garments./\r\n5. They did not get married./\r\n6. They did not try to have children./\r\nAlthough these reasons seem entirely unrelated, we could suggest that all seven of them stem from one fundamental fault. Nadav and Avihu were great people, and they were aware of their high spiritual level. Yet they felt they had already reached the pinnacle of their achievement, and therefore had no need to strive for further growth and self-improvement. This misjudgment was the root of all seven possible reasons for their death:/\r\n\r\n1. Nadav and Avihu felt they had reached completion and perfection, so it seemed fitting for them to take over leadership of the Jewish people./\r\n2. They felt they had achieved the epitome of Torah knowledge, so they made Jewish legal decisions in front of their rabbi./\r\n3. Since they assumed they had reached their maximum potential, they felt they could relax, so they entered the holy area while intoxicated./\r\n4. Since they felt they had reached the height of purity, they no longer needed water to become purified, so they entered the holy area without first washing their hands and feet./\r\n5. Since they felt they had achieved perfection, they no longer needed the atonement provided by the priestly garments {Arachin 16a}, so they entered the holy area without wearing them./\r\n6. They assumed that, since they had perfected themselves, God could speak with them at any time - as He did with Moses, who separated from his wife, Tzipporah, due to this consideration {Numbers 12:7-8} - so they did not get married./\r\n7. Since they did not get married, they were halachically forbidden from having children outside of marriage./\r\n* * */\r\nTHE MEASURE OF A MAN/\r\n\r\nNow that we see the common source of the seven reasons, let us examine another detail of the story. The Torah tells us {Leviticus 10:2} that a fire consumed Nadav and Avihu after they brought their strange offering. According to the Yalkut Shimoni {524}, this fire came from the Holy of Holies. Why is it relevant to know the source of the fire?/\r\n\r\nThe Holy of Holies contained only one vessel: the Holy Ark. Unlike the other Temple vessels, the dimensions of the Ark were all fractions - 2.5 by 1.5 by 1.5 cubits {Exodus 25:10}. According to the commentator Kli Yakar, the fractional measurements of the Ark teach us that we should always feel lacking in regards to the wisdom we have acquired. Each of the Ark's dimensions teaches us a different dimension of this lesson. The height of the Ark shows us that we lack depth of knowledge; the length shows us that we lack breadth of knowledge; and the width shows us that we lack the ability to grasp concepts./\r\n\r\nIn Hebrew, the same word midot means both \"measurements\" and \"character traits.\" This is why the fire that consumed Nadav and Avihu came from the Holy of Holies: the resting place of the Ark. The Ark, with its fractional measurements {midot} teaches us that we, too, are fractional - lacking in Torah knowledge and imperfect in our refinement of character {midot}. Nadav and Avihu thought that they had reached completion. The origin of the fire that consumed them showed that they still had work to do./\r\n\r\nIf this lesson was relevant to such great people as Nadav and Avihu, it is all the more relevant to us. Although we should take pleasure in our positive achievements, we should never take pride. We should not feel so satisfied with our accomplishments that we lose our yearning to stretch and grow further./\r\n\r\nMay we continually desire to push beyond our current level, and in the merit of this attitude, may we soon deserve to see the return of our centerpiece, the Ark, with the building of the Third Temple."},{ID:27,parshaId:27,vort:'This week\'s Torah portion primarily deals with the phenomenon of a "negah" - a physical skin disease that expresses a spiritual ailment. The Sefer Yetzirah {2:7} states that there is nothing greater than "oneg" {delight} and nothing lower than "negah." How are we to understand this enigmatic remark?/\r\nThe Midrash Socher Tov {citing Rebbe Yitzchak on Psalm 92} notes that all aspects of Shabbat are doubled. In the Holy Temple, the meal offering consisted of a double portion {Exodus 16:22}; the animal offerings consisted of two lambs {Numbers 29:9}; the punishment for desecrating Shabbat is described with double wording {Exodus 31:14}; the reward for observing Shabbat contains double wording {Isaiah 58:13}; the commandment to observe Shabbat appears in two forms, "zachor" {Exodus 20:8} and "shamor" {Deut. 5:12}; and the Psalm that was sung on Shabbat has two names, "mizmor" and "shir" {Psalms 92:1}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Shem MiShmuel, the Midrash is not merely mentioning that Shabbat is associated with double expressions. Rather, we learn from here that the very essence of Shabbat is twofold. On one hand, Shabbat is called the "secret of oneness" {Zohar}, through which all Jews are equated. On the other hand, Shabbat is likened to the Coming World, where every righteous person receives reward based on his individual merit {see Shmot Rabba 52:3 and Shabbat 152a}. The Shem MiShmuel explains these two aspects as follows:/\r\n\r\nAll Jewish people are equal when it comes to refraining from transgressions. In passivity, we are all alike. This is the first aspect of Shabbat - the oneness in which all Jews are equated. The other aspect of Shabbat, as we mentioned, is where each person receives reward based on individual merit. This refers to the mitzvot that require action to fulfill. Far from being equated in this realm, we each grow differently depending on how much energy, sincerity, and pure intention we put into our performance of mitzvot./\r\n\r\nWe can broaden this discussion and suggest that the Jewish people have a dual mission. We have a unified, national mission, in which we are all equated. However, each individual has a unique, specific mission as well - a mission that is different from everyone else\'s./\r\n\r\nTypically, the idea of a personal mission is understood to mean using our individual talents to bring something unique into the world. Based on the Shem MiShmuel, we now see that we can also fulfill our individual mission through our performance of mitzvot. Although everyone\'s actions might appear to be identical, in reality, each person performs mitzvot with a different degree of enthusiasm and care.\r\n\r\nThe "metzora" - the one smitten with a spiritual skin disease - is disqualified from both his national and his individual mission. The Torah tells us {Leviticus 13:46} that the metzora dwells alone, which the Talmud {Arachin 16b} understands to mean "outside the Jewish camp." This enforced solitude symbolizes the metzora\'s disqualification from the Jewish people\'s national purpose./\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we learn that the metzora is locked away for a week {Leviticus 13:4} or sometimes two weeks {Leviticus 13:5}. This shows us that different people require different amounts of time to extricate themselves from their spiritual degradation. The amount of time necessary for each metzora to heal is based on the unique way he developed his corrupt behavior. This demonstrates the ruination of the metzora\'s individual mission, since the time it takes him to heal is directly based on how much effort he put into performing transgressions./\r\n\r\nNow we can finally understand the comment from the Sefer Yetzirah that there is nothing greater than oneg and nothing lower than negah. {This is a play on words: both are composed of the three letters ayin, nun, gimmel.} The word oneg is frequently used in association with Shabbat. Nothing is greater than the oneg of Shabbat because, as we stated, the essence of Shabbat is twofold. Shabbat fully expresses both the national and the individual purpose of the Jewish people, thus symbolizing serving God in totality and completion. Negah, on the other hand, symbolizes the utter degradation of the metzora, who is disqualified from both his national and individual mission. Nothing could be lower than this inability to fulfill one\'s purpose on any level./\r\n\r\nMay we all be doubly blessed to live up to our national and individual missions, thereby enabling us to serve God in totality and completion.'},{ID:28,parshaId:28,vort:"The Sages were eloquent on the subject of lashon hara, evil speech, the sin they took to be the cause of tsara\u2019at. But there is a meta-halachic principle: \u201cFrom the negative you can infer the positive\u201d1 So, for example, from the seriousness of the prohibition against Chillul Hashem, desecrating God\u2019s name, one can infer the importance of the opposite, Kiddush Hashem, sanctifying God\u2019s name./\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that alongside the grave sin of lashon hara, there must in principle be a concept of lashon hatov, good speech, and it must be more than a mere negation of its opposite. The way to avoid lashon hara is to practise silence, and indeed the Sages were eloquent on the important of silence.2 Silence saves us from evil speech but in and of itself it achieves nothing positive. What then is lashon hatov?\r\n\r\nOne of the most important tasks of a leader, a parent or a friend is focused praise. We first discussed this idea in parshat Vayeshev, where we examined the classic text on this \u2013 a Mishnah in Tractate Avot {2:11} in which Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai enumerates the praises of his five beloved students:/\r\n\r\nEliezer ben Hyrcanus: a plastered well that never loses a drop. Joshua ben Chananya: happy the one who gave him birth. Yose the Priest: a pious man. Shimon ben Netanel: a man who fears sin. Elazar ben Arach: an ever-flowing spring./\r\n\r\nEvery Rabbi had disciples. The imperative, \u201cRaise up many disciples\u201d3 is one of the oldest rabbinic teachings on record. What the Mishnah is telling us here is how to create disciples. It is not difficult to create followers. Often a good teacher will, over time, notice that they have developed a large following, students who are uncritical devotees \u2013 but how to encourage these followers to become creative intellects in their own right? It is far harder to create leaders than to create followers./\r\n\r\nRabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was a great teacher because five of his students became giants in their own right. The Mishnah is telling us how he did it: with focussed praise. He showed each of his pupils where their particular strength lay. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, the \u201cplastered well that never loses a drop,\u201d was gifted with a superb memory \u2013 an important ability in an age in which manuscripts were rare and the Oral Law was not yet committed to writing. Shimon ben Netanel, the \u201cman who fears sin,\u201d may not have had the intellectual brilliance of the others but his reverential nature was a reminder to others that they were not merely scholars but also holy men engaged in a sacred task. Elazar ben Arach, the \u201cever-flowing spring,\u201d had a creative mind constantly giving rise to new interpretations of ancient texts./\r\n\r\nI discovered the transformative power of focused praise from one of the more remarkable people I ever met, the late Lena Rustin. Lena was a speech therapist, specialising in helping children who struggled with stammers. I came to know her through a television documentary I was making for the BBC about the state of the family in Britain. Lena believed that the young children she was treating \u2013 they were, on average, around five years old \u2013 had to be understood in the context of their families. Families tend to develop an equilibrium. If a child stammers, everyone in the family adjusts to it. Therefore if the child is to lose their stammer, all the relationships within the family will have to be renegotiated. Not only must the child change. So must everyone else./\r\n\r\nBy and large, we tend to resist change. We settle into patterns of behaviour as they become more and more comfortable, like a well-used armchair or a well-worn pair of shoes. How do you create an atmosphere within a family that encourages change and makes it unthreatening? The answer Lena discovered was praise. She told the families with whom she was working that every day they must notice each member of the family doing something right, and say so \u2013 specifically, positively and thankfully./\r\n\r\nShe did not go into deep explanations, but watching her at work I began to realise what she was doing. She was creating, within each home, an atmosphere of mutual regard and continuous positive reinforcement. She wanted the parents to shape an environment of self-respect and self-confidence, not just for the stammering child but for every member of the family, so that the entire atmosphere of the home was one in which people felt safe to change and help others to do so./\r\n\r\nI suddenly realised that Lena had discovered a solution not just for stammering but for group dynamics as a whole. My intuition was soon confirmed in a surprising way. There had been tensions among the television crew with which I had been working. Various things had gone wrong and there was an atmosphere of mutual recrimination. After filming a session of Lena Rustin teaching parents how to give and receive praise, the crew likewise began praising one another. Instantly the atmosphere was transformed. The tension dissolved, and filming became fun again. Praise gives people the confidence to let go of the negative aspects of their character and reach their full potential./\r\n\r\nThere is in praise a deep spiritual message too. We think religion is about faith in God. What I had not fully understood before was that faith in God should lead us to have faith in people, for God\u2019s image is in each of us, and we have to learn how to discern it. I then understood that the repeated phrase in Genesis 1, \u201cAnd God saw that it was good,\u201d was there to teach us to see the good in people and events, and by so doing, help to strengthen that goodness. I also understood why God briefly punished Moses by turning his hand to tsara\u2019at \u2013 because he had said about the Israelites, \u201cThey will not believe in me.\u201d {Ex. 4:1} Moses was being taught a fundamental lesson of leadership: It does not matter whether they believe in you. What matters is that you believe in them./\r\n\r\nIt was from another wise woman that I learned another important lesson about praise. Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, in her book Mindset4, argues that it makes a decisive difference whether we believe that our abilities are innate and determined once and for all {the \u201cfixed\u201d mindset}, or whether we may assume that talent is something we achieve through time by effort, practice and persistence {the \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset}. People who take the former approach tend to be risk-averse, afraid that if they fail this will show that they are not as good as they were thought to be. The latter group embrace risk because they take failure as a learning experience from which they can grow. It follows that there is good praise and bad praise. Parents and teachers should not praise children in absolute terms: \u201cYou are gifted, brilliant, a star!\u201d They should praise effort: \u201cYou tried hard, you gave of your best, and I can see the improvement!\u201d They should encourage a growth mindset, not a fixed one./\r\n\r\nPerhaps this explains a sad aftermath in the life of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai\u2019s two most gifted pupils. The Mishnah immediately following the one quoted above states:/\r\n\r\nHe [Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai] used to say: If all the Sages of Israel were in one scale of a balance and Eliezer ben Hyrcanus in the other, he would outweigh them all. However, Abba Saul said in his name: If all the Sages of Israel, including Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, were in one scale of a balance, and Elazar ben Arach in the other, he would outweigh them all. {Avot 2:12}/\r\n\r\nTragically, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was eventually excommunicated by his colleagues for failing to accept the majority view on a matter of Jewish law.5 As for Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, he became separated from his colleagues. When they went to the academy at Yavneh, he went to Emmaus, a pleasant place to live but lacking in other Torah scholars. Eventually he forgot his learning and became a pale shadow of his former self.6 It may be that praising his students for their innate abilities rather than their effort, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai inadvertently encouraged his two most talented students to develop a fixed mindset rather than engage with colleagues and stay open to intellectual growth./\r\n\r\nPraise, and how we administer it, is a fundamental element in leadership of any kind. Recognising the good in people and saying so, we help bring people\u2019s potential to fruition. Praising their efforts rather than their innate gifts helps encourage growth, about which Hillel used to say: \u201cHe who does not increase his knowledge, loses it\u201d {Mishnah Avot 1:13}. The right kind of praise changes lives. That is the power of lashon hatov. Bad speech diminishes us; good speech can lift us to great heights. Or as W. H. Auden said in one of his beautiful poems:/\r\nIn the prison of his days\r\nTeach the free man how to praise."},{ID:29,parshaId:29,vort:'In this week\'s parsha {Leviticus 18:3}, God charges the Jewish people not to behave like the Egyptians, from whose culture we came, or the Canaanites, who inhabit the Land of Israel. What is the nature of this command? If the point is to steer us away from immoral behavior, the Torah explicitly tells us a few verses later {Leviticus 18:6-30}. What does it mean, then, that we are instructed not to act like the Egyptian or Canaanite nations?/\r\n\r\nMoreover, at the beginning of Parshat Kedoshim, the Torah states, "Be holy" {Leviticus 19:2}. Rashi interprets this statement to mean that we must separate ourselves from immorality./\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel {vol. 1} takes issue with Rashi\'s comment, and wonders: can someone who disengages from immorality really be called "holy"? Imagine a eulogizer at a funeral praising the deceased by saying, "This man was truly holy. Not once did he engage in adultery, incest, or bestiality!" Committing these sins is wickedness; refraining from them seems to be merely maintaining the status quo. How can Rashi understand the statement "Be holy" as a command to stay away from obvious misdeeds?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe begins to address our question by explaining what it means to act like an Egyptian. In his view, the Torah is not telling us to avoid performing prohibited actions; rather, it is teaching us how to engage in permitted physical activities. Even in the realm of permissible behavior, we must not overindulge or seek out passion for passion\'s sake, as the Egyptians did. Instead, we must act like Jews, striving to perform every action in a healthy, balanced way, with the ultimate goal of fulfilling God\'s will./\r\n\r\nNachmanides expresses a similar idea, as he mentions that our Sages {in Torat Kohanim} explain the statement "Be holy" as "Be separate." The Torah permits pleasurable physical activities - eating kosher meat, drinking kosher wine, intimacy between husband and wife - yet someone who is driven by lustful passions may overindulge in these activities while thinking that he is still within the bounds of Torah law. Such a person is called a "glutton" {see Proverbs 23:20}. Thus, after Parshat Acharei Mot lists all the specific prohibitions regarding immorality, Parshat Kedoshim teaches us generally, "Be holy." We must separate ourselves from overindulging in permissible activities, curbing our appetites in order to maintain dignity and holiness./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nMAKE A FENCE/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, the Tiferet Shmuel answers our question of how Rashi can imply that we are called "holy" merely by staying away from immorality. The Talmud states, "Sanctify yourself with that which is permitted to you" {Yevamot 20a}. Another passage {Avodah Zara 17a} elaborates on this idea, in which a Nazir {one who has voluntarily decided to abstain from wine} is advised not to take a shortcut through a vineyard, but rather to walk all the way around it. Strictly speaking, a Nazir may pass through a vineyard - he is only prohibited from partaking of the grapes. But since walking through a vineyard would put him in such close proximity to the prohibition, a "fence" is necessary to protect him from possible temptation. {See Avot 1:1, which states, "Make a fence for the Torah."}/\r\n\r\nIf we accustom ourselves to avoid overindulgence in that which is permissible, we surely will not engage in prohibited behavior./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tiferet Shmuel, this is what Rashi means when he interprets "Be holy" as "Be separate from immorality." The words "be separate" indicate that we should curb our appetites even in permitted areas. Then, after restating our Sages\' words, Rashi explains the reasoning behind them: "from immorality." The Tiferet Shmuel understands the word "from" to mean "because of." Due to the prohibitions against immoral behavior, we must make a fence around them to ensure that we stay far away from any wrongdoing./\r\n\r\nBased on this view, there is no contradiction between Rashi and Nachmanides; both are emphasizing the importance of maintaining holiness even in permitted activities. Furthermore, we can now understand why Rashi\'s language seemed to differ from that of our Sages. In fact, he uses the same expression {"be separate"}, but then adds a reason afterwards./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to escape from the "Egypt" within us, little by little each day, by engaging in permitted behavior in a healthy, balanced way.'},{ID:30,parshaId:30,vort:'In this week\'s Torah portion, we find the famous imperative, "Love your fellow as yourself, I am God" {Leviticus 19:18}. Rashi {on Torat Kohanim} cites Rebbe Akiva, who said of this mitzvah, "This is a great principle in Torah" {Zeh klal gadol baTorah}. From these few words, a number of questions come to mind:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Why does the verse, "Love your neighbor as yourself" conclude with the words, "I am God"? {This question can be asked every time a verse concludes with the words, "I am God," but for now, we will focus on this verse.} The implication of this statement is, "I am God who commands you to do this mitzvah." Surely we know by now, more than halfway through the Torah, that we perform mitzvot because they are the will of God! What does this statement mean?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. What does Rebbe Akiva mean when he says, "This is a great principle in Torah"? Since when do our Sages rate the mitzvot?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Rashi, in many other places, explains that the statement, "I am God" comes to teach us that God is "ne\'eman l\'shalem s\'khar" - that He is believed to pay reward. Why does Rashi use the word "ne\'eman," which implies belief, instead of the seemingly more appropriate word "batuach" {sure}? Divinely-allotted reward and punishment is not dependent on our belief; it is guaranteed! Why not say so?/\r\n \r\n\r\nMaimonides suggests an idea that will help us resolve these difficulties. He states that two people can perform exactly the same mitzvah, yet be granted entirely different amounts of Heavenly reward. How is this fair? Maimonides explains that one person may have performed the mitzvah with great difficulty, whereas the other person may not have been challenged by it at all. A simple example is with the mitzvah of tzedaka {charity}. A rich person who gives a dollar to a needy individual is judged quite differently than a person who is struggling to get by, yet still manages to scrape together a dollar to give to charity. We are rewarded according to the level of effort we put into our performance of mitzvot and the level of difficulty this entails./\r\n\r\nNow we can answer our third question. Rashi says that God is believed to pay reward, rather than saying He is guaranteed to do so, because we must believe that God takes into consideration the effort we put into our mitzvot. Although the actions themselves do have inherent value, the level of difficulty for us in performing them leads to differing levels of spiritual reward. There is no way we could ever empirically compute this - so we must believe that God knows how to combine all the variables and reward us fairly./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nHUMBLE AND GREAT/\r\n\r\nIn order to answer our two remaining questions, we must explore the accepted concept among philosophers that love can exist between people only when they have many things in common. The Tiferet Shmuel {vol. 1} explains that, based on this idea, one might mistakenly think that it would be difficult for great leaders and scholars to love common, ordinary people. If love depends on similarity, how could a scholar who spends his days delving into the intricacies of Jewish texts possibly cultivate love for the average person? What does an accomplished scholar have in common with a ditch-digger?/\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that common ground helps people build relationships, Judaism rejects the hierarchical underpinnings of this idea. The Torah says of Moses that he was the greatest prophet who ever lived {Deut. 34:10}, and also that he was the humblest person on the face of the earth {Numbers 12:3}. These seem like contradictory statements. Didn\'t Moses realize he towered over everyone else? How could he be humble?/\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel explains that, although Moses recognized his unique capabilities, he viewed everyone within the context of their circumstances. When meeting an average person, Moses would think, "Perhaps the five minutes of Torah learning that this water carrier squeezes into the end of his exhausting day are more precious to God than all my achievements!" In this way, Moses maintained his humility./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly Maimonides\u2019 point that we mentioned earlier - that God evaluates the effort it takes to perform a mitzvah. There is no way for us to know whose effort is worth more or less. Every learned person must try to adopt Moses\'s attitude of humility, and think, "Perhaps this simple, ordinary person is actually greater than me in God\'s eyes. Perhaps his effort is worth more."/\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel thus understands the command, "Love your fellow as yourself," to be addressing the leaders and scholars. God tells them, "Love everyone - even average people - as yourself." If the scholar claims that such love is impossible because of the vast differences between him and the average person, God concludes the command with the words, "I am God" - in other words, "I am the one who assigns reward." Why should the scholar assume that he is on a higher level than the average person? The average person might be equal or greater because of the effort he invested!/\r\n\r\nThis answers our first question. The verse, "Love your fellow as yourself" does not conclude with the words, "I am God" in order to identify God as the source of the mitzvah. Rather, these words teach us that God can be trusted and believed to reward people according to their effort. This also answers our second question. Rebbe Akiva is not rating or ranking this mitzvah. Rather, his statement must be read as follows: Zeh klal... Gadol b\'Torah. In other words, "This principle [is intended for those who are] great in Torah"! The principle "Love your fellow as yourself" is especially relevant to those great scholars who might be tempted to think that they have little in common with the average person./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to make a shift in our thinking and approach each person we meet with the thought, "How would I fare if I were in his shoes?" May we merit to see the atmosphere of camaraderie and love that will arise from this perspective, and may we thus deserve to experience the world coming full circle and returning to its state of paradise.'},{ID:31,parshaId:31,vort:'Shaking off layers of self-centered physicality and materialism in order to elevate our existence./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s Torah portion discusses the mitzvah of the Omer, which involves counting seven weeks from Passover until Shavuot. The Torah tells us that the Omer offering, which was brought to the Temple on the second day of Passover, must be "waved before God." This waving is clearly an integral part of the mitzvah, but it is not explained. What is the significance of waving the Omer offering? How does this mitzvah connect to the seven-week Omer period in which we currently find ourselves?/\r\n\r\nWe are taught that the Omer offering was composed of barley, which our Sages considered to be animal food. The bread offering on Shavuot, however, was composed of wheat - a more dignified grain, appropriate for human consumption. By looking at the composition of these two offerings, we can begin to understand the goal of the seven-week intermediate period between them. During this time between Passover and Shavuot, we have the opportunity to change from animals into people - to elevate our baser nature, which is driven by desires alone, and to channel its energy into the pursuit of a more meaningful, spiritually-oriented existence./\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentator Netivot Shalom, this is the purpose of waving the Omer offering. Waving represents shaking off - in this case, shaking off layers of self-centered physicality and materialism in order to elevate our existence. We see a hint to this idea in the parsha itself {Leviticus 23:9-22}, which mentions waving seven times. We could suggest that these seven mentions of waving correspond to the seven weeks between Passover and Shavuot. Each week we have the ability to shake off another layer./\r\n\r\nWhat are these layers, exactly? All the physical aspects of this world were initially created in seven days. Each week of the Omer period thus "shakes off" one of these physical layers of Creation. As we progressively refine and elevate ourselves, we prepare ourselves to receive the Torah on Shavuot./\r\n\r\n{Nachmanides actually sees the seven weeks of the Omer quite literally as seven days. He writes that the Omer period can be considered a Chol Ha\'Moed [intermediate festival period] between Passover and Shavuot. Since we start counting toward Shavuot on the second day of Passover, the holidays are fundamentally connected. Thus, instead of the usual seven-day duration of a festival, the "festival" of time from Passover until Shavuot lasts seven weeks, with each week representing a day. And, says Nachmanides, just like the Chol Ha\'Moed of Sukkot is capped by Shmini Atzeret, so too the "Chol Ha\'Moed" of Passover is capped by Shavuot, referred to by the Torah as "Atzeret."}/\r\n\r\nThe Jewish zodiac signs also illustrate the goal of progressive transformation. The Omer period always falls out during the three months of Nisan, Iyar and Sivan. The sign for Nisan is a sheep, and the sign for Iyar is an ox. These first two months are represented by animals, corresponding to our more animalistic nature at the beginning of the Omer period and the lower level of the barley offering that is brought then./\r\n\r\nThe sign for Sivan, however, is twins - people! By working on ourselves throughout the seven weeks of the Omer, we can steadily progress, week by week, until we reach the level of people who are prepared to receive the Torah./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to transform ourselves not just weekly, but also daily, as we grow towards a more meaningful, purposeful, and spiritual existence. By the time we reach Shavuot, may we stand at the peak of our potential, in the service of God.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:32,parshaId:32,vort:'Why we don\u2019t lose when performing mitzvot./\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, we find the following verse:/\r\n\r\n"If your brother becomes poor and his hand fails with you [an expression indicating poverty], you should uphold him." {Leviticus 25:35}/\r\n\r\nA number of questions confront us when reading this verse:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Why does the Torah use a double expression of poverty? Doesn\'t the first part of the verse suffice to explain the situation?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Why does the second expression of poverty {"his hand fails with you"} include the words, "with you"? These words would seem to imply that the potential giver also became impoverished, which is not true!/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. The Midrash {Vayikra Raba 34:1} states that this verse clarifies the verse in Psalms {41:2} that reads, "Fortunate is one who considers the poor person; on a bad day, God will save him." What does the Midrash mean? What is the connection between these two verses?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. Furthermore, it would seem more sensible for the verse in Psalms to read, "Fortunate is the one who gives to the poor person." What is the benefit in merely considering the poor? What is the meaning behind the choice of words in Psalms?/\r\n \r\n\r\nWe can begin to approach these questions by examining an interesting statement about tzedakah. According to the Arizal, the act of giving tzedakah to a poor person is not only a mitzvah; it actually forms the Name of God! The coin is essentially a dot, which represents the Hebrew letter that is most dot-like: yud. The giver then takes the coin in the five fingers of his hand. The hand thus represents the Hebrew letter with the numerical value of five: hei. The giver stretches out his hand to give the coin, forming a straight line with his arm that resembles the shape of the Hebrew letter vav, whereupon the poor person opens his hand {hei} to receive the coin. In this way, God\'s Name {yud, then hei, then vav, then hei} has been spelled in order./\r\n\r\nWe can use this idea to explain the verse, "A rich man and a poor man meet; God makes them all" {Proverbs 22:2}. Although the literal interpretation of the verse is as we just stated, we could also understand it, based on the Arizal\'s idea, to mean, "A rich man and a poor man meet; all together, they make God {oseh kulam Hashem}"! [God\'s Name is spelled out in the verse]. In other words, the encounter between the giver and the recipient of tzedakah enables the two people to form the Name of God./\r\n\r\nThis is true, however, only if the giver initiates. If the poor person must request tzedakah before the giver provides it, God\'s Name is spelled out of order. In this unfortunate scenario, the poor person opens his hand {hei} and stretches out his arm {vav}, whereupon the giver reaches out his hand {hei} and gives the coin {yud}. These are still the letters of God\'s Name, but the Name is spelled backwards {hei-vav-hei-yud}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tikkunei Zohar {10a}, it is auspicious for the letters yud and vav to come before the hei\'s in God\'s Name. {When God\'s Name is spelled in order, the letter yud comes before the first hei and the letter vav comes before the second hei.} Having the letters in this order represents mercy, life, and peace, because they spell God\'s Name in the correct order./\r\n\r\nWhen God\'s Name is in order, life flows in order. When God\'s Name is out of order, however, and the hei\'s come before the letters yud and vav, a scenario of strict justice, death, and poverty is indicated. Chaos results from God\'s Name being spelled out of order. Such a situation can come about, as we saw before, when a poor person must initiate the mitzvah of tzedakah, thus spelling God\'s Name backwards {hei-vav-hei- yud}./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nOUTSTRETCHED HAND/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tiferet Shmuel, these ideas will help us understand the answer to the first question. The phrase, "and his hand fails with you" {u\'matah yado imach} is not repetitious. Rather, it can be translated as, "and his hand moves with you" - in other words, stretch out your hand first! The Torah is cautioning us that when a poor person stretches out his hand, he should be following our lead. We - not the poor - should initiate the mitzvah of tzedakah./\r\n\r\nThis also answers the second question, regarding the problematic words "with you." We can understand these words as an instruction, meaning, "See to it that the poor person\'s hand is with your hand, not by itself." If the poor person\'s hand is alone, it indicates that he had to reach out first, which is undesirable. If the poor person\'s hand is with your hand, however, it shows that you initiated the giving./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash we mentioned earlier picks up on these nuances, which is why it connects this verse to the verse in Psalms, "Fortunate is the one who considers {maskil} the poor." Now we can see why the verse does not define as fortunate one who merely gives to the poor, which will answer the fourth question. The word "maskil" comes from the word "sechel," meaning "intelligence." A person who gives tzedakah without intelligence, by waiting until he is asked, creates the energy of death and destruction in the world. A person who gives with intelligence, however, and is ready to reach out his hand to the poor before he is asked for assistance, creates the Name of God in the world, which brings the energy of life and health./\r\n\r\nThis answers the third question as well. The Midrash understands the intent of the verse in this week\'s portion, which is why it connects it to the verse in Psalms. Both verses refer to the same situation./\r\n\r\nHow can we learn to be proactive, and to initiate giving rather than merely responding to requests for aid? The key is to develop love for the mitzvot we\'ve been given. If we cultivate an attitude of joy and love toward mitzvot, we will be on the lookout for any opportunity to fulfill them. The Arizal, for example, attributed all the incredible greatness he achieved to the joy he put into performing mitzvot. {A story is told that, once, when the Arizal went to buy the four species before Sukkot, he was so excited that he threw his entire wallet full of money to the store owner, saying, "Take whatever you want!"}/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n \r\n\r\nENTHUSIASM ON SINAI/\r\n\r\nThis week\'s parsha gives us a hint about how to develop enthusiasm toward mitzvot. The parsha opens by describing the agricultural laws of the Sabbatical year {"shmita"}, in which the land is required to rest every seventh year. We notice one seemingly unnecessary detail before the presentation of these laws. The verse says, "God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying..." {Leviticus 25:1}./\r\n\r\nRashi asks the obvious question: wasn\'t every law given to Moses on Mount Sinai? Why are the laws of shmita specifically singled out? Rashi answers that, just as God taught Moses the general laws of shmita as well as all the intricate details relating to it, so, too, did He teach Moses the general principles and the details of all the mitzvot at Mount Sinai./\r\n\r\nBut this only answers half the question. Why was shmita, in particular, the mitzvah chosen to serve as an example? Any mitzvah could have taught us this lesson! We can resolve this problem if we examine the fundamental nature of the mitzvah of shmita./\r\n\r\nThe shmita laws are completely counter-intuitive. To farmers who rely on yearly crop yield, it would seem that keeping this mitzvah would inevitably lead to catastrophic financial loss. Yet God promises that no loss will come about through the fulfillment of the shmita laws. On the contrary; He assures us that performing this mitzvah will lead to profit and gain! This is why shmita was used as an example. It is the ultimate demonstration that we cannot lose by fulfilling mitzvot - even mitzvot that we would expect to result in severe monetary loss./\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, teaches us how to relate to all the other mitzvot that require spending money {buying the four species for Sukkot; restocking our kitchens for Passover; giving tzedakah}. We learn from the shmita laws that we will never lose by performing a mitzvah. With this knowledge, we can develop an attitude of eagerness and enthusiasm towards mitzvot - even those that require us to dig deep into our pockets./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to have such love for the performance of mitzvot, that we initiate opportunities to give a helping hand to others. And in this merit, may we be blessed with only gain in life.\r\n\r\n'},{ID:33,parshaId:33,vort:'Parshat Bechukotai contains a series of blessings and curses. Surprisingly, only 11 verses are dedicated to blessings {Leviticus 26:3-13}, while a full 36 verses are dedicated to curses {Leviticus 26:14-46}. The contrast is striking. Why are there so many more curses than blessings? It almost seems as though someone is out to get us!/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, King David writes in Psalms, "Your staff and Your rod have comforted me" {Psalms 23:4}. It seems strange that he would use this imagery to depict comfort, since staffs and rods are instruments of pain. If King David wanted to use soothing symbolism, why didn\'t he write something like, "Pillows and cushions have comforted me"?/\r\n\r\nThe Chafetz Chaim cites the Talmud {Brachot 5a}, in which Rava explains that God smites His desired ones with pains and difficulties, as the verse says, "The one whom God desires is smitten with illness" {Isaiah 53:10}. We also find a support to this idea in the verses, "God chastises the one He loves, like a parent who desires the child" {Proverbs 3:12} and "Fortunate is the one whom God afflicts with pains and suffering" {Psalms 94:10}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nA MOTHER\'S CARE/\r\n\r\nBased on these verses, we can understand why King David used staffs and rods as examples of comfort. Staffs and rods are instruments of pain - and this is precisely the idea that King David found so comforting! The pain itself is a sign that God loves us. But how? Let us explore this idea with a concrete example./\r\n\r\nImagine you\'re walking down the street, and a few yards ahead of you, a group of children is playing ball. At a certain point, the ball is kicked into the gutter, and a 5-year-old boy runs out to retrieve it. He is so focused on the ball that he doesn\'t look for oncoming traffic, and he dashes into the street directly in front of a car. The driver notices the boy at the last second, slams on the brakes, and the car comes to a screeching halt - missing the boy by an inch./\r\n\r\nYour reaction to this scene, as a pedestrian, would most likely be to hold your breath in horror, and then, when you see that the boy is unharmed, to continue on your way, perhaps shaking your head about the impulsiveness of children./\r\n\r\nIf the boy\'s mother were witnessing the scene, on the other hand, she would react differently. Initially, she will also hold her breath in horror - but when she sees that her son is unharmed, she will run over to him, drag him off the street, and spank him soundly, all the while yelling that he should never, ever do that again!/\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the difference between you and the boy\'s mother? You don\'t care about the boy as much as his mother does. She loves him so much that she will temporarily inflict pain on him in order to teach him a lesson./\r\n\r\nLet us quickly explore five additional points that support the idea that pain indicates God\'s love for us:/\r\n\r\n1. The Ramchal {Mesillat Yesharim 1} states that challenges and difficulties remind us of the transience of this world. When, due to our pain, we realize that life is really about the next world, we can realign our values and live in accordance with what is lasting and true./\r\n2. Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch explains that pain strengthens our moral fiber and molds us. Going through difficult experiences helps us to be sensitive to others\' pain and helps us to appreciate good in our lives. Pain is therefore a gift from the One who loves us {"no pain, no gain"}, and crises and problems can be seen as opportunities for growth./\r\n3. Our pain can cause us to cry out to God, thus affording us the opportunity to develop a relationship with our Creator. This is not the same as prayer by rote; this is a much deeper level. Calling out from the depths of our heart and initiating a conversation with God in our own language is a powerful way to build a relationship with Him./\r\n4. Maimonides {Hilchot Ta\'aniyot 1:3} teaches that tragedies strike in order for us to repent and return to God./\r\n5. Pain cleanses us from any mistakes we may have made in the past./\r\n* * */\r\nCURSES AND BLESSINGS/\r\n\r\nOf course, despite all the benefits of pain, we must never ask for challenges in this area. But when troubles come on their own, ironically, our very suffering should bring us happiness and joy. The tractate of the Talmud devoted to the laws of mourning is called "Tractate of Happiness" {found at the end of Tractate Avodah Zara}. On a simple level, we can understand this as meaning that a mourner is not permitted to attend festivities and celebrations. On a deeper level, however, the title indicates that mourning is actually a happy occasion./\r\n\r\nThis explains why Parshat Bechukotai contains more curses than blessings. The curses themselves are a sign that God loves us and wants us to receive all the benefits that come from the difficulties. As the Midrash {Devarim Raba 1:4} points out, Bilam ultimately blesses the Jewish people, while Moses ultimately curses the nation. Why would our arch-enemy give us a blessing and our devoted leader give us a curse?/\r\n\r\nBilam doesn\'t want us to benefit from all the positive opportunities that come with pain. He simply wants to compliment us, to reassure us that everything is okay, so that we will not have the chance to grow beyond our current level. Moses, on the other hand, who loves us and really cares, doesn\'t let us off the hook. He chastises us harshly in order to make sure we become the best that we can be.\r\n\r\nGod loves us even more than Moses. Because of this, the curses in Parshat Bechukotai are even harsher than the curses that Moses gives in the Book of Deuteronomy {see Rashi on Leviticus 26:19 in contrast to Deut. 28:23}. We see this in the most tragic month on the Jewish calendar, as well, the month in which both Temples were destroyed and numerous other national tragedies occurred. This month is called "Av," which is the Hebrew word for "father." The calamities of Av teach us that our Creator loves us deeply. If God didn\'t care about us, He wouldn\'t bother to send us the opportunities of pain./\r\n\r\nWe can each choose whether or not to implement these ideas in our own lives in order to help us cope, change our attitudes, and better manage our own challenges. We must remember, however, never to lecture other people when they are going through a period of suffering. When others are in pain, our job is simply to be there for them, cry with them, feel their pain, and do whatever we can to provide comfort./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with the strength to face challenges and difficulties with a healthy frame of mind, so that we clarify the purpose of life, stretch ourselves to the maximum, and become as close as possible to God, Who is loving us every moment.'},{ID:34,parshaId:34,vort:'Hard work, happiness and humility are the keys to success in Torah learning./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s parsha is always read before Shavuot, the festival of receiving the Torah. What is the connection is between the two? How does Parshat Bamidbar prepare us for the festival of Shavuot?/\r\n\r\nThe first verse in this week\'s portion tells us that God spoke to Moses in the Sinai desert {Numbers 1:1}. The Midrash {Bamidbar Rabba 1:7} questions why it is necessary for the Torah to specify the location in which God spoke to Moses. According to the Midrash, our Sages derive from this detail that three elements were present when the Torah was given: fire, water and desert./\r\n\r\nWe learn about fire from the verse, "All of Mount Sinai was smoking because God descended upon it in fire" {Exodus 19:18}. Water is specified in the verse, "The heavens dripped with water" {Judges 5:4}, which describes the giving of the Torah. Finally, we learn about the desert from the phrase "in the Sinai desert" in this week\'s portion. What message is the Torah trying to convey by listing the weather conditions at the time we received the Torah?!/\r\n\r\nThere are three primary keys to success in Torah learning:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Hard work and intense involvement in study./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Happiness and joy while studying.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Humility coming from the knowledge that, ultimately, our achievements in learning are not a result of our own efforts, but due to the kindness of God who gives us Torah./\r\n \r\n\r\nWe see a hint to these three attributes in the Talmudic opinions regarding the blessings one must recite before studying Torah {Brachot 11b}. The Talmud lists three opinions:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Rav Yehuda, in the name of Shmuel, claims that one must recite the blessing, "...who has commanded us to be involved in the study of Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Rebbe Yochanan claims that we should say instead, "May You make the words of Torah be sweet in our mouths."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Rav Ham\'nuna claims that we should say, "Blessed are You, the One Who gives Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Talmud concludes that we should follow all of these opinions, and recite all three blessings before beginning Torah study./\r\n\r\nMaking a blessing over a mitzvah prepares us to fulfill the mitzvah. Thus, making a blessing before we begin to study Torah prepares us for the mitzvah of learning Torah. Once we understand this, we can see that these three blessings mentioned in the Talmud correlate exactly to the three keys for successful Torah learning that we listed initially:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "to be involved in the study of Torah" corresponds to the hard work that is necessary to invest in studying./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "make the words of Torah sweet in our mouths" corresponds to the happiness and joy we must feel when engaged in study./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "the One Who gives Torah" corresponds to the humility that results when we realize that our achievements are not due to our own effort, but are actually a result of Divine benevolence./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nKEYS TO SUCCESS/\r\n\r\nBased on the Shem MiShmuel, we can now understand the deeper message of the Midrash in listing the three elements that were present at the giving of the Torah:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFire symbolizes hard work. We see this explicitly in the Yiddish word "farbrent" {literally, "on fire"}, which is used to describe intense effort in Torah learning. As we mentioned above, the idea of hard work corresponds to the blessing, "to be involved in the study of Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWater symbolizes happiness. In the Land of Israel, rain is considered a blessing and a benefit. We should all be happy when it rains, since almost every aspect of our lives depends on water. This idea corresponds to the blessing, "make the words of Torah sweet in our mouths."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe desert represents humility. It is low and flat, and people walk all over it. This corresponds to the blessing, "the One Who gives Torah" - since, as we mentioned, it takes humility to recognize that our own efforts are not the ultimate cause of our success./\r\n \r\n\r\nNow we can finally understand why Parshat Bamidbar is read right before Shavuot. On Shavuot, we do not simply commemorate the original acceptance of Torah, but we accept the Torah upon ourselves anew. In order to prepare ourselves to truly receive Torah on this day, Parshat Bamidbar gives us the keys that will enable our Torah learning to succeed./\r\n\r\nMay we all be triply blessed: to work hard in learning the Torah that was given at Mount Sinai in fire, with sweet happiness that feels as good as cool water, so that this Shavuot will be a humble, down-to-earth acceptance of God\'s extraordinary gift.'},{ID:35,parshaId:35,vort:'One of the highlights of Parshat Naso is the Priestly Blessing. The text of this blessing, which the Kohanim bestow upon the Jewish people, concludes, "May God turn His face to you and give you peace" {Numbers 6:26}./\r\n\r\nOur Sages speak very highly of the quality of peace. For example, we find the statement in the Midrash {Bamidbar Raba 11:7} in the name of R\' Shimon bar Chalafta, "Great is peace, for there is no vessel that can receive blessing other than peace." The Midrash brings a proof to this idea from the verse {Psalms 29:11}, "God will bless His nation with peace."/\r\n\r\nWe can understand this idea more deeply by taking a closer look at the phrase, "His nation." The Jewish people are composed of three categories of people: Priests {Kohanim}, Levites {Leviim}, and Israelites {Yisraelim}. The Hebrew acronym of the words "Kohanim," "Leviim," and "Yisraelim" spells the word kli, which means "vessel." Once we understand that the Jewish people themselves are a vessel, we can gain a more profound insight into the Midrash\'s statement. The vessel of the Jewish people can receive blessing only when there is peace!/\r\n\r\nWe can offer four primary pieces of advice for how to achieve peace with others:/\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that all our efforts are for God\'s sake. If we do everything for the honor of God, and not for the sake of boosting our own ego, we can view one another as part of the same team, pooling all of our different strengths and talents for a common goal./\r\n2. Train ourselves to see only the good in others. Instead of being threatened or challenged by others\' differences, view the differences as positive qualities./\r\n3. The Peleh Yoetz suggests that we should focus on the reward we receive for making peace, as an incentive to pursue it. He gives a striking example. Imagine a person approaches you and asks you to make peace with someone you can\'t stand. Your initial reaction is to immediately turn down the offer. Then the person asks, "What if I give you $50? Do you think you could try? How about $100? Or $1,000? If I give you $100,000, could you do it? How about two million dollars?" There is a point at which every person would give in and decide it was worth the effort to make peace.\r\nAccording to the Peleh Yoetz, the reward we get in the World to Come for making peace far outweighs any financial bonus this world can offer. This knowledge should be an incentive to us to make peace./\r\n\r\n4. Making peace sometimes requires us to compromise or to give in. We can do this only if we cultivate our humility and learn to be satisfied with the minimum./\r\n* * */\r\nTHREE LEVITE FAMILIES/\r\n\r\nAlthough these four points are important, we can also suggest another approach in understanding God\'s expectation of us when it comes to peace. The beginning of this week\'s Torah portion focuses on the tribe of Levi, which is composed of three main families: Kehat, Gershon, and Merari. Based on the Shem MiShmuel and the Netivot Shalom, we can understand these three families as representing three spiritual levels./\r\n\r\nThe family of Kehat represents the highest, most righteous level. Their role is to carry the Holy Ark {Rashi on Numbers 4:4} - the highest component of the Tabernacle. The importance of this task underscores their lofty spiritual level./\r\n\r\nThe family of Gershon represents the middle level. They carry the curtain that divides the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Sanctuary {Numbers 4:25}. One side of the curtain is close to the intense sanctity of the Holy of Holies, while the other side is not. We could suggest that this curtain hints to the spiritual level of an average person, who fluctuates between moments of intense devotion and moments of feeling less connected to the Divine./\r\n\r\nThe family of Merari represents the lowest level. They carry the beams and pillars of the Sanctuary {Numbers 4:31}, the weight of which can be burdensome. This physical weight represents the heaviness of the lowest spiritual level./\r\n\r\nThe tribe of Levi is charged with teaching the Jewish people how to attach themselves to the Divine {see Rambam, "Shmita V\'Yovel," 13:12-13}. The three main families in this tribe show us that we are required to serve God not only when we are on a spiritual high, like the most righteous people, and not only when we feel average, but even when we feel the lowest and furthest away from God. Regardless of the emotional state in which we find ourselves, we must commit ourselves to doing God\'s will with a positive attitude./\r\n\r\nThis idea will offer us a new perspective on God\'s expectation of peace. In addition to being at peace with others, we must learn to be at peace with ourselves - whatever level we are functioning on. When we are frustrated with ourselves, it is much more likely that we will lash out at others. Being at peace with ourselves, however, usually leads to our being at peace with others. If we can learn from the tribe of Levi how to maintain our inner equilibrium, we have a much better chance at establishing peace with others as well./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to cultivate within ourselves the four primary qualities that lead to peace: acting only for God\'s sake; seeing the good in others; focusing on the rewards earned through this behavior; and being humble and satisfied with the minimum, which will enable us to compromise. Most important, may we learn to be at peace with ourselves. May we recognize the worth of our service, even at its lowest point, and realize that, even then, we have the potential to function at the highest level.'},{ID:36,parshaId:36,vort:"In this week's parsha, we find one of the most perplexing passages in the Torah. The Jewish people in the desert are suddenly overwhelmed by a craving for meat {Numbers 11:4}. God is \"angered\" by the people's desire, but nevertheless promises to provide an abundance of meat for them - an entire month's worth, \"until it comes out of your noses\" {Numbers 11:20}./\r\n\r\nAt this point, Moses asks God a series of seemingly outrageous questions: \"I am living amidst 600,000 people who are traveling by foot, and You say You will supply a month's worth of meat for them? Can enough sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them? Would all the fish of the sea be enough for them?\" God responds to Moses's questions, \"Is My Hand short? Now you will see whether I am good for My word or not\" {Numbers 11:21-23}./\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how Moses, who had the closest possible relationship with the Divine, could have explicitly doubted God's ability to provide. If God created the entire world ex nihilo, why should it be difficult for Him to provide sufficient meat for the Jewish people? Although many commentators grapple with this issue, we will present the opinion of the Da'at Zekainim {Numbers 11:23}./\r\n\r\nThe generation of the desert had a unique law that prohibited the slaughter of meat solely for personal consumption. Therefore, a person who wanted to eat meat was obligated to bring an offering to the Tabernacle. He would slaughter an animal, place a portion of the meat on the altar, and give a portion to the Kohanim. Only the remaining third of the meat belonged to the owner who had brought the offering./\r\n\r\nThe Priests were required to finish their portion of meat before dawn of the following day. Any meat that was leftover at daybreak became invalid and had to be burned - an act that ideally was to be avoided. Therefore, the Priests made every effort to consume the meat within the appointed time./\r\n\r\nBased on these laws, the Da'at Zekeinim explain Moses\u2019s words in the following way. God said that He would provide the people with a month's worth of meat in one day. Moses is certain that God can fulfill His word - but imagine hundreds and thousands of people suddenly converging at once on the Tabernacle with their animals! There were only three Kohanim {Aaron and his two sons} to serve the entire Jewish people. How would it be possible for them to eat such a vast quantity of sacrificial meat before dawn?/\r\n\r\nFurther, according to the Da'at Zekeinim, Moses\u2019s question, \"Can You provide enough fish for them?\" {Numbers 11:22} is to be read as a statement. Moses was implying, \"If You had promised to provide fish for them, they would be able to eat whatever they wanted, since we don't bring offerings from fish. But because You said, 'I will provide meat for them,' they will need to bring a sacrifice! How can You expect Aaron and his sons to eat so much meat within the allotted time?\"/\r\n\r\nGod responds, \"Is My Hand short?\" When God said He would provide meat, He meant quail: a type of bird from which no offering is brought! Therefore, this would circumvent any possibility of leftover meat./\r\n\r\nFowl is considered to have the halachic status of meat, but the origins of this categorization are debatable. Was this law derived directly from the Torah, or did it result from a later decision of the Sages? From this passage we see that when God said \"meat,\" He was referring to quail. According to the opinion of the Da'at Zekeinim, we could therefore suggest that fowl's status as meat is given directly by the Torah./\r\n\r\n[This is the view held by Tosefot {Chullin 104b}. For further analysis, see Maimonides {Mamrim 2:9}, Yorah Deah 87:3 and Shach 4.]/\r\n\r\nThe Da'at Zekeinim, by understanding the dialogue this way, justify Moses's surprising words. Moses never doubted God's ability to provide. If anything, the limitation was with the people./\r\n\r\nAs we sit down at our dinner table, may we enjoy some delicious meat and some meaty words of Torah, and in this way have a full and complete experience./\r\n\r\n"},{ID:37,parshaId:37,vort:'This week\'s parsha deals with the story of the spies who scouted out the Land of Israel and returned with a negative report. Their unfavorable portrayal of the land caused the entire Jewish people to despair of the possibility of living there and to voice their desire to return to Egypt. God was "angry" at the spies for speaking negatively about the land, and decreed that the entire generation "will die in the desert" {Numbers 14:35}./\r\n\r\nApparently, God never forgave the Jewish people for this sin. Even to this day, we bear the consequences for the spies\' evil report. The verse, "The people wept that night" {Numbers 14:1} refers to the night of Tisha B\'Av. The Talmud {Taanit 29a} teaches that as punishment for the people\'s weeping needlessly over the spies\' report, God caused many tragedies to happen on Tisha B\'Av so that, throughout the generations, we would have "good reason to cry."/\r\n\r\nThe severity of this punishment is very unusual. The Jewish people have made many errors and misjudgments over the course of history, yet rarely have the consequences been so severe. Why was the mistake of the spies so unforgivable?/\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses reminds the Jewish people of their complaints in the desert: "You spoke slander in your tents, saying, \'It is because God hates us that He took us out of the land of Egypt" {Deut. 1:27}. Rashi uses a comparison to explain how the Jewish people came to that conclusion. Imagine a king who had two sons and two fields. One field was self-irrigated {shakya}, while the other relied on rain for irrigation {ba\'al}. The king gave the self-irrigated field to the son he loved, so the son would never have to worry about his crops, while he gave the field dependent on rainwater to the son he hated./\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people saw that God had taken them out of Egypt - a lush, fertile land, where the Nile River provided a constant source of irrigation - and was taking them to the Land of Israel, which depended on rainfall. They thus concluded that God must hate them. Based on Rashi\'s parable, this seems like a logical inference. The Torah does not directly address the people\'s assumption, and the question is left hanging. How is the journey from Egypt to the Land of Israel to be seen as anything other than a punishment?/\r\n\r\nIf we view the Land of Israel only in terms of the physical and material benefits it provides, then there may certainly be more comfortable places to live. However, if we look beyond the superficial qualities of Israel, and use our inner vision to perceive its spiritual advantages, then it is far better to live in Israel and depend on rainfall than it is to live in Egypt with no worries about water. Why? The very fact of our dependence on rain forces us to develop ourselves spiritually. If there is no rain, we must pray, and turning heavenward compels us to recognize the true Source of sustenance./\r\n\r\nThis could be one reason that a field that relies on rainwater is called a ba\'al. The word ba\'al literally means "owner" or "master." Living in the Land of Israel constantly reminds us that the world has a ba\'al, and our reliance on Him keeps our relationship strong./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR IN ISRAEL/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can understand why the Jewish people were never forgiven for the sin of the spies. According to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spector, the punishment we received teaches us how stringently God views a negative attitude toward the Land of Israel. If we cut ourselves off from the Land of Israel, we cut ourselves off from the extraordinary spiritual advantages that the land has to offer and all the opportunities for growth that it provides. Severing ourselves from this potential defeats the entire purpose of our existence./\r\n\r\nEvery year at this time, students who have spent the year studying in Israel go back to the Diaspora to spend the summer with their families. For many, their first Shabbat abroad is parshat Shlach. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the timing works out this way. When everyone gathers together around the Shabbat table and the family begins asking, "How was your year in Israel?", these students literally have the opportunity to rectify the sin of the spies./\r\n\r\nMost of the spies saw only the physical, external aspects of the Land, and many things seemed strange to them. Because they saw only these superficial elements, and failed to see the land\'s inner spiritual beauty, they concluded that Israel was a bad and dangerous place to live. Visitors to Israel today are the "spies" of this generation. They have the choice of joining forces with the ten spies who viewed the land negatively, or siding with Yehoshua and Calev, who had deeper, inner vision and perceived the land\'s spiritual richness. Before we open our mouths to share our experiences in the Land of Israel with our family and friends, let us pause for a moment and think about what we are about to say./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to visit and live in Israel, so that we can focus wisely and deeply on what is truly important in life, and pursue it with a fire that will elevate us to the highest levels.'},{ID:38,parshaId:38,vort:'This week\'s parsha tells the story of a man named Korach who led a mutinous rebellion against Moses and Aaron. Korach claimed that the entire Jewish people was holy, and therefore it was inappropriate for Moses and Aaron to exalt themselves over the people {Numbers 16:3}. Moses responds to Korach, "In the morning, God will make known who is His own and who is the holy one, and He will draw him close to Him" {Numbers 16:5}./\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that Moses would want to wait until the morning to resolve such a critical issue. Why not settle the matter immediately?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Rashi {based on Midrash Tanchuma 7} teaches that Korach spent the entire night going around to each tribe and trying to gain support for his rebellion. Why does the Midrash stress that Korach went around at night?/\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, certain actions that are not explicitly condemned in the Torah are nevertheless considered more severe than sins that are explicitly mentioned. Korach, by arguing against his rabbi, provides one example of this principle. The Talmud {Sanhedrin 110a} teaches that one who disagrees with, argues with, complains against, or suspects his rabbi is considered to be exhibiting all these behaviors toward God Himself./\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the Talmud can equate a rabbi with the Divine - a comparison that seems to border on idolatry! - we must examine another Talmudic passage {Ketubot 111b}. Several verses in the Torah {Deut. 4:4, Deut. 30:20} instruct us to cleave to God. The Talmud wonders how this is possible, since God is described as an all-consuming fire {Deut. 4:24}. How can we be expected to attach ourselves to a blaze of perfect holiness?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud answers by explaining that anyone who marries his daughter to a Sage, does business with a Sage, or uses his property to give pleasure to a Sage {for example, providing him with a meal} is considered as if he attached himself to the Divine Presence./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, the purpose of the Torah and all its mitzvot is to enable us to cleave to God {d\'veikut}. One mitzvah in particular, however, helps us achieve this goal more than all the others: cleaving to Torah scholars. When the Talmud compares a rabbi to God, it does not mean that the rabbi is God, God forbid. Rather, our connection and attachment to a rabbi brings us to a deeper connection to God. From observing how our Sages behave, even in the most mundane areas {eating, speaking, walking, conducting business}, we learn how to become God-like in every facet of life. In this way, we become closer to God./\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can see the severity of Korach\'s error. When Korach stated, "The entire congregation is holy," {Numbers 16:3}, he was implying that the Jewish people no longer needed to have a rabbi. It seems that Korach wanted to prevent the Jewish people from cleaving to Torah scholars, thereby preventing them from cleaving to God. According to this understanding, Korach was rebelling not only against Moses and Aaron, but against the very purpose of Torah and mitzvot./\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the letters of Korach\'s name provide a hint to this idea, since they form the acronym of the phrase Chalak Kedushat Rabo {"He argued on the sanctity of his rabbi"}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSUN AND MOON/\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand why Moses waited until the morning to resolve the dispute with Korach, whereas Korach acted at night. The Midrash {Shmot Raba 15} teaches that the Jewish people are compared to the moon. We can understand this statement based on the Talmud\'s {Chullin 60b} explanation of an apparent contradiction in the Torah, which states, "God made the two great luminaries, the great luminary to serve by day and the small luminary to serve by night" {Genesis 1:16}. How can two "great" luminaries be different sizes?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud explains that originally the sun and the moon were both the same size. However, the moon complained to God, "Can two kings share the same crown?" God acknowledged the moon\'s objection, saying "Go and diminish yourself."/\r\n\r\nMaimonides {Laws of Kiddush HaChodesh} states that the moon does not generate its own light, but is rather a reflection of the sun\'s light. According to the Toldot Yaakov Yosef, the moon initially complained to God because it thought it did generate its own light. God\'s response {"Go and diminish yourself"} was intended to teach the moon the true nature of its illumination. It is as if He told the moon, "You think you provide your own light because you are so close to the sun. Once you create some distance {"go"}, you will see on your own {"yourself"} that you are small."/\r\n\r\n[This is not the straightforward understanding of the Talmud, in which God literally made the moon smaller. According to this new approach, the first half of the verse, which refers to the two great luminaries, describes how the luminaries appeared. The second half of the verse clarifies what was actually there. God never created two equal "kings" in the first place.]/\r\n\r\nNow we can see why the Jewish people are compared to the moon. The moon does not generate its own light and needs the light of the sun in order to shine. The masses of the Jewish people also do not start out with their own light; we need a rabbi, who is compared to the sun, to give us light and help us shine. A rabbi has his own light because he has already achieved d\'veikut with God, whereas the majority of us are still working toward that goal./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nEVIDENT AT NIGHT/\r\n\r\nThe Tifferet Shmuel {vol. 2} points out that the moon\'s mistake occurred at night. When the moon was directly opposite the sun, shining brightly, it assumed it generated its own light. In the daytime, however, when there is a greater distance between the sun and the moon, it became obvious that the moon never generated its own light at all./\r\n\r\nThis is why the Midrash stresses that Korach tried to gain support for his rebellion at night. Korach lived in darkness. Although he was a Torah scholar, he got so close to Moses, his rabbi, that he began to think he had his own light. Therefore, he tried to gain followers at night, because he shone most brightly at that time. Moses, on the other hand, knew the true source of Korach\'s light. This is why he waited until the morning to resolve the issue. In the daytime, it would be obvious that Korach was merely a reflection of Moses\'s light. Perhaps he would realize on his own that he still needed a rabbi./\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the remedy for Korach\'s error can also be found in the letters of his name. The letters of korach can be rearranged to spell the word rachok {"distant"}. In the daytime, when the sun and the moon are farther apart, Korach could see with clarity what was not evident at night. The letters of korach also spell the word kerach {"ice"}. With the clarity of distance, Korach could have seen that he was as cold as ice without Moses, and that he did not have his own fire at all./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to find and follow a real rabbi who speaks to us and whose light will cause us to shine. In this way, may we grow ever closer to God, becoming more and more God-like, so that we may be elevated to the highest levels.\r\n'},{ID:39,parshaId:39,vort:"Among the many topics discussed in Parshat Chukat, we find the story of the Jewish people's complaints about the \"destructive bread\" {the manna}. God was displeased with the people's complaints, and responded by sending a plague of poisonous snakes to bite the Jewish people, causing numerous deaths./\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe shares an insight into the crime of the Jewish people. According to his approach, the people resented the way God was guiding the world. Although the people realized that God was in the driver's seat, they were not happy with where He was taking them./\r\n\r\nWe learn in the Talmud {Avot 4:1} that a truly wealthy person is one who is happy with his portion. The Slonimer Rebbe interprets this to mean that a wealthy person is one who is happy with the unique set of circumstances that God has allotted to him. We find a proof to this in another place {Avot 5:3}, which says that Abraham passed all 10 tests he was given./\r\n\r\nThis statement makes sense in reference to some of the tests - for example, the command to circumcise himself at an advanced age. In order to pass this test, Abraham had to take action - to take a knife to his own flesh. However, other tests did not require action. We might wonder, for example, how Abraham passed the test of \"learning that his descendents would have to suffer through years of exile.\" Although Abraham was privy to future information in this instance, there was nothing that he could do!/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe claims that Abraham passed these types of tests by accepting God's decisions with love. This teaches us a potent lesson. We are often pained when bitter changes occur in our lives. Obviously, the first course of action is to try to change the difficult situation. However, if we see that a particular situation is temporarily or permanently unchangeable, our test is to change ourselves to meet the challenge. In other words, we need to learn how to live with unchangeable circumstances so that we change and mature. Although the situation may be inflexible, we can change ourselves to become more sensitive, tolerant and patient people. This is how Abraham responded to his unchangeable circumstances./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSPIRITUAL FOOD/\r\n\r\nThis idea applies to our parsha, as well. It seems strange that the Jewish people would begin complaining about the manna at the end of their 40 years in the wilderness. They had been eating it for this entire period of time! Couldn't they hold out just a little longer? The manna would finish in another 36 days, upon the Jewish people's entry into the Land of Israel!/\r\n\r\nWe can understand a novel insight into the Jewish people's complaint based on the teachings of the Megala Amukos. According to this view, the Jews were not complaining about the manna. Rather, at the end of 40 years, they saw that there was going to be a change from spiritual food {manna} to physical food. Entry into the Land of Israel would require them to begin cultivating and eating regular food. Unlike the manna, this physical food would not be completely absorbed by their bodies - and it is this physical food that the Jews called \"destructive bread,\" because they were dismayed at the prospect of once again excreting waste! How, they asked themselves, would they be able to maintain high spiritual levels while eating physical food? It is so much easier to maintain lofty spiritual heights when eating spiritual food!/\r\n\r\nInstead of being happy with God's decision, they complained. Instead of focusing inward to bring out their potential of changing themselves to meet this external change, they were simply disappointed with God's conduct./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to be happy with what we have, avoiding panic, frustration and complaint, in order to pass our 10 tests of life when the circumstances are unchangeable.\r\n"},{ID:40,parshaId:40,vort:"Parshat Balak tells the story of a Moabite king named Balak who is terrified by the Jewish people's presence on the border of his country. Since the Jews were recently victorious over the mighty armies of Sichon and Og {see Numbers 21:31-35}, Balak knows that he will be unable to defeat them militarily. Instead, he tries a different approach: he hires a gentile prophet, Bilam, whom he instructs to curse the Jewish people and thereby destroy them {Numbers 22:5-6}. {Balak's behavior has contemporary overtones. Today we see many examples of those who try to destroy Israel politically when they recognize that they will be unable to do so by force.}/\r\n\r\nThe Zohar {3:210a} makes a statement that leads us to examine this story more carefully: Balak was a great sorcerer! If so, why did he need to hire Bilam to destroy the Jewish people? Why couldn't Balak simply have done the job himself?/\r\n\r\nWe can explain this based on the Yesod V'Shoresh HaAvodah {2:3:12, citing Maimonides' \"Moreh Nevuchim\"}, which states that when a Jew is attached to the Divine, he is protected from all negativity and strict judgments. According to this view, bad things happen to righteous people only in moments of interruption and distraction. This breaks their focus and severs their attachment to God, which creates an opening for negativity to enter./\r\n\r\nThe Netivot Shalom uses this idea to explain the mechanics of blessings and curses. A blessing creates connection and attachment to God, whereas a curse creates separation and distance from God. Bilam's power to curse therefore indicated his goal: to separate the Jewish people from their closeness to the Divine./\r\n\r\nNow we can understand why Balak needed Bilam's help in destroying the Jews. As long as the Jewish people were attached to the Divine, they were immune from all negative forces. Even the most powerful sorcery and magic in the world could have no effect on them. Balak therefore wanted Bilam to curse the Jews in order to break their strong connection to God. If this connection could be broken, then Balak's evil sorcery would be able to penetrate and the Jews would be destroyed./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nTRANSFORMING THE CURSE/\r\n\r\nAs the parsha continues, however, we see that Bilam is unable to curse the Jews, despite his repeated efforts to do so. In fact, every time Bilam tries to curse the Jewish people, God forces him to utter words of blessing instead! The Talmud {Sanhedrin 105b} comments on this, saying, \"From the blessings of that wicked man, you learn what was in his heart.\" Apparently, Bilam's true intentions were not completely disguised by the blessings he was forced to speak. How can we deduce Bilam's original intent?/\r\n\r\nThe verse tells us, \"God, your God ... transformed the curses into blessing, because God, your God, loves you\" {Deut. 23:6}. Blessings are the opposite of curses. Therefore, we should be able to deduce Bilam's true intentions by simply reading the opposite of what he said! For example, Bilam says, \"He did not see any sin in Yaakov or any crookedness in Yisrael. The Lord his God is with him, and the King's friendship is within him\" {Numbers 23:21}. This blessing, like many of Bilam's blessings, implies a very close relationship to the Divine - a connection of warmth and attachment. From here we can deduce that Bilam would have preferred to curse us with utter separation and detachment from God./\r\n\r\nBefore Bilam utters his final blessing, the Torah tells us that he \"saw the Jewish people dwelling together in their tribes\" {Numbers 24:2}. This paints a picture of a nation that lives in harmonious, tight-knit communities. According to the Netivot Shalom, such a feeling of closeness and attachment stems from love - since, when we love someone, we want to be with them all the time. This teaches us an important lesson. In order to achieve a level of close relationship with God, we must first cultivate it among ourselves. Our efforts to develop deep connections with other people are an exercise to help us ultimately develop a deep connection with God./\r\n\r\nWe see a proof to this idea in the famous verse, \"Love your fellow as yourself, I am God\" {Leviticus 19:18}. Why does God need to identify Himself at the end of this verse? Don't we know by now that God, the source of all the Torah's commandments, is the source of this commandment as well? The Netivot Shalom explains that the verse is not intended to teach us the source of the mitzvah; rather, it is teaching us the progression of our relationships. Only after we develop the ability to love other people as ourselves can we know how to experience closeness with the Divine./\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nONE PLUS LOVE/\r\n\r\nWe see a hint to this idea in the Hebrew word echad {literally, \"one\"}, which symbolizes unity, oneness, attachment. The numerical value of the word echad is 13, and the value of ahava {love} is also 13. If we add echad to ahava, the result is 26: the same numerical value as the four-letter Name of God. We can learn from here that when one person attaches to another person with closeness and love, it ultimately leads to the same relationship with God./\r\n\r\nA practical way of creating closeness and love in our own lives is to bless each other. By giving blessings, we can create an environment of love, acceptance, and connection. This brings us closer together, leading to the possibility of achieving closeness with God as well. If, however, we curse each other instead {God forbid}, we create division and disunity among ourselves, which cuts us off from God, leaving us unprotected from negativity./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the scenario that Balak hoped for when he hired Bilam to curse us. He did not want Bilam's curse to stand alone. Rather, Balak hoped that Bilam would incite us to curse each other, thereby driving a wedge between the Jewish people and God and making us susceptible to all the negative energies of the world./\r\n\r\nMay we never forget what happened in the times of Balak and Bilam. May we learn that the only way to protect ourselves from negative energy is by attaching ourselves to God, and that we can achieve closeness with God only by bringing ourselves closer to each other. May we learn that blessing each other creates a powerful force of unity, and may our blessings constantly pour forth and flow among us lovingly, protecting us from any calamity.\r\n"},{ID:41,parshaId:41,vort:"Bridging the gap between mind and heart.//\r\n\r\nThis parsha tells of the war waged by the Jews against the nation of Midian, in retaliation for the Midianite women's enticement of the Jewish men. Moses {Numbers 31:3} charges the people to prepare \"anashim\" {men} to wage this war, which Rashi understands as meaning \"righteous people.\" According to the Midrash {Shir HaShirim Raba 4:3}, these people were righteous because they never donned the tefillin of the head before donning the tefillin on the arm. Had they had done so, Moses would not have praised them as righteous people and they would not have been victorious in war./\r\n\r\nThis seems strange, for two reasons. First of all, Jewish law requires that a person don the box of tefillin on the arm before donning the box on the head. Why, then, is doing so considered a righteous quality that renders a person fitting for war? Furthermore, the Torah does not mention the proper donning of tefillin as a requirement for any previous war. Why is it specifically mentioned in regard to the war against Midian?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {Netivot Shalom} addresses these questions with a striking statement: \"Judaism is dependent upon the lesson gleaned from the commandment of tefillin.\" This lesson is that a Jew must dedicate both his heart and his mind to the service of God. {It should be noted that a person can benefit from the message of tefillin even without wearing it.} Let us take a closer look at the essence of the heart and the mind in order to further understand this lesson of tefillin./\r\n\r\nThe heart is the source of our passions and desires, whereas the mind is the source of our outlooks and intellectual views. Human nature tempts us to give free reign to our passions and then to create intellectual justifications for succumbing to them. This is precisely why Jewish law requires us to don the arm tefillin before the head tefillin. The box on the arm, which lies opposite the heart, teaches us to channel our passions to God. Only then can we dedicate our intellectual energies to the Divine and trust that our philosophies are not distortions of reality./\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the Torah refers to tefillin as an \"ot\" {\"sign\"} {Exodus 13:9}. The sign of a true Jew lies in his mastering the art of channeling his heart's desires to God, therefore enabling him to trust that his intellectual reasoning is correct and true./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *//\r\n \r\n\r\nMIDIANITE WOMEN/\r\n\r\nThis idea helps us understand why men who donned tefillin properly were the soldiers in the war against Midian. In order to defeat Midian, the Jews needed to counteract the scheme of the gentile prophet Bilam, who arranged the downfall of the Jewish people. Bilam encouraged the daughters of Midian to become prostitutes in order to entice the Jewish men to acts of immorality. Bilam knew that God would be unable to tolerate such behavior {see Sanhedrin 106a, based on Numbers 24:14} and would swiftly destroy the perpetrators of the immoral acts./\r\n\r\nFrom here we see that Bilam understood how to use the lesson of tefillin in a destructive way. He first planned to corrupt the hearts of the Jewish people, because he knew that, once their hearts were swayed, their minds would follow./\r\n\r\nThis idea is borne out in the order in which the Torah discusses the event. First, the passions of the heart are mentioned - \"The Jews began to commit immoral acts with the [Midianite] daughters\" {Numbers 25:1} - and then, several verses later, we see the subsequent impurity of the mind, when the people began worshipping idols {Numbers 25:3}. The people's idol worship provided an intellectual justification for their immoral actions - since, according to the idolatrous Midianite philosophy, all behavior is acceptable. The sin of the Jewish men with the Midianite women demonstrates that, once we have a desire in our heart, our minds can fabricate any justification to carry out that desire./\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the Jewish retaliation against Midian required that the people use the lesson of tefillin in a positive way. This was accomplished by selecting soldiers who donned the arm tefillin prior to the head tefillin. The box on the arm, which channels the heart's desires to the Divine, prevents immorality, while the box on the head, which channels the mind's philosophies to the Divine, prevents idolatry. Therefore, we can understand that the men who went to war were not righteous simply because they fulfilled the technicality of tefillin; rather, they embodied its powerful message! They first directed the heart's passions to God in order to then successfully channel the mind's philosophies to God as well./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *///\r\n \r\n\r\nBELIEF IN GOD/\r\n\r\nRabbi Elchanan Wasserman {in Kovetz Ma'amarim} uses this idea to explain why even some of the world's greatest thinkers and philosophers have been unable to acknowledge the existence of God. In his view, the existence of an Ultimate Creator is simple and obvious. Just as a home testifies to a builder, so does the world, which is far more complex and sophisticated, testify to a Creator. Nevertheless, many great minds have not recognized this self-evident argument, for the simple reason that accepting it would require them to change their lifestyle. Belief in a sophisticated God, who imposes guidelines for proper conduct, prevents people from living according to their desires. Therefore, in order to carry out the heart's desires, people can conjure up outrageous philosophies to justify that lifestyle./\r\n\r\nThis idea also enables us to understand the Torah's command to believe in God {Maimonides, Sefer Mitzvot, positive #1, based on Exodus 20:2}. How could the Torah possibly command an unbelieving person to believe in a Creator? It is simply not within that person's power! The answer, according to Rabbi Wasserman, is that the command is not intended to force a person to have belief. Rather, we are commanded to remove the obstacles that prevent us from believing in God - which is to say, the unbridled passions of the heart. Once we remove these blockages, belief in God is a natural result./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to become real Jewish soldiers, by channeling first our heart's passions and then our mind's outlooks, so that we can stand as a sign for the rest of the world that there is only one God who created the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{ID:42,parshaId:42,vort:"Bridging the gap between mind and heart.//\r\n\r\nThis parsha tells of the war waged by the Jews against the nation of Midian, in retaliation for the Midianite women's enticement of the Jewish men. Moses (Numbers 31:3) charges the people to prepare \"anashim\" (men) to wage this war, which Rashi understands as meaning \"righteous people.\" According to the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Raba 4:3), these people were righteous because they never donned the tefillin of the head before donning the tefillin on the arm. Had they had done so, Moses would not have praised them as righteous people and they would not have been victorious in war./\r\n\r\nThis seems strange, for two reasons. First of all, Jewish law requires that a person don the box of tefillin on the arm before donning the box on the head. Why, then, is doing so considered a righteous quality that renders a person fitting for war? Furthermore, the Torah does not mention the proper donning of tefillin as a requirement for any previous war. Why is it specifically mentioned in regard to the war against Midian?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe (Netivot Shalom) addresses these questions with a striking statement: \"Judaism is dependent upon the lesson gleaned from the commandment of tefillin.\" This lesson is that a Jew must dedicate both his heart and his mind to the service of God. (It should be noted that a person can benefit from the message of tefillin even without wearing it.) Let us take a closer look at the essence of the heart and the mind in order to further understand this lesson of tefillin./\r\n\r\nThe heart is the source of our passions and desires, whereas the mind is the source of our outlooks and intellectual views. Human nature tempts us to give free reign to our passions and then to create intellectual justifications for succumbing to them. This is precisely why Jewish law requires us to don the arm tefillin before the head tefillin. The box on the arm, which lies opposite the heart, teaches us to channel our passions to God. Only then can we dedicate our intellectual energies to the Divine and trust that our philosophies are not distortions of reality./\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the Torah refers to tefillin as an \"ot\" (\"sign\") (Exodus 13:9). The sign of a true Jew lies in his mastering the art of channeling his heart's desires to God, therefore enabling him to trust that his intellectual reasoning is correct and true./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *//\r\n \r\n\r\nMIDIANITE WOMEN/\r\n\r\nThis idea helps us understand why men who donned tefillin properly were the soldiers in the war against Midian. In order to defeat Midian, the Jews needed to counteract the scheme of the gentile prophet Bilam, who arranged the downfall of the Jewish people. Bilam encouraged the daughters of Midian to become prostitutes in order to entice the Jewish men to acts of immorality. Bilam knew that God would be unable to tolerate such behavior (see Sanhedrin 106a, based on Numbers 24:14) and would swiftly destroy the perpetrators of the immoral acts./\r\n\r\nFrom here we see that Bilam understood how to use the lesson of tefillin in a destructive way.

These wanderings from place to place are as a lesson about the transience and temporality of life in this world. According to the Degel Machaneh Ephraim {based on the Baal Shem Tov}, the 42 places that the Jews encamped in the desert represent the 42 phases within each person\'s life./  This idea seems to follow the statement of the Nachmanides {Genesis 12:6, citing Tanchuma 9} that "the actions of the forefathers are repeated by their descendants." In other words, just as the Jewish people in the desert were transient wanderers, constantly moving from place to place, so, too, is our existence in this world temporary./  A hint to this idea is found in this week\'s parsha, yet in order to understand it, we must first go back to the beginning of Creation. The second verse of the Torah {Genesis 1:2} reads, "And the earth was EMPTINESS and VOID, and DARKNESS was on the face of the DEPTHS, and THE SPIRIT OF God hovered over the face of the waters."/  The Midrash {Bereishis Raba 2:4, in the name of Reish Lakish} interprets this verse as a prophecy about the future exiles of the Jewish people. EMPTINESS symbolizes the Babylonian exile; VOID refers to the Persian-Medean exile; DARKNESS represents the Syrian-Greek exile; and the DEPTHS refers to the current Roman exile. THE SPIRIT OF God alludes to the spirit of the Messiah, who will ultimately redeem the Jewish people from exile. {See the Midrash for numerous verses that support these correlations.}/  This Midrash shows that God, in addition to creating the laws of nature, made the exiles of the Jewish people an integral part of Creation. This idea is very difficult to understand. Why would God decree the exiles before creating the world? At the outset of Creation, there weren\'t even any Jews! Why would God punish the Jewish people before they did anything wrong - and even before He created them? For although God knows from the beginning what the outcome will be in any given situation, He still relates to us on our own terms./  * * */ FOUR EXILES/  We could suggest that the purpose of exile is not to punish us for misbehavior. Rather, the purpose of exile is to remind us that this world is a transient, temporary place. The many upheavals and expulsions throughout Jewish history have forcibly prevented us from ever feeling a sense of permanence./  According to the commentator Nachal Kadumim, this idea is hinted to in the first verse of Parshat Masei, Eleh Masei B\'nei Yisrael - "These are the journeys of the Jewish people" {Numbers 33:1}. The initials of these four Hebrew words stand for the four exiles that the Jewish people have experienced throughout the ages: Edom {Rome}, Madai {Persia-Medea}, Bavel {Babylon}, and Yavan {Syria-Greece}. The exiles are hinted to in this parsha because they convey the same message as the 42 places that the Jews encamped in the desert. Both teach us about the transience and impermanence of the physical world./  Let\'s give some examples of this idea. Imagine taking an elevator to the top of the Empire State Building. Would it ever occur to you to vacuum the carpet or polish the mirrors in the elevator? You\'d never bother, because you know you\'re going to get off any minute. This world is like an elevator {and we hope we\'re all going to get off at the top floor}! What is the use of getting overly involved in material pleasures? As our Sages say, "This world is like a lobby compared to the World to Come. Prepare yourself in the lobby so you will be able to enter the banquet hall!" {Avot 4:21}/  A related story is told about a man who was traveling across Europe about a hundred years ago. When he reached Poland, he decided to visit the town of Radin, where the great sage the Chafetz Chaim lived. He took his luggage from the train station and went straight to the Chafetz Chaim\'s house, where he was graciously ushered in. Once inside, the traveler couldn\'t believe his eyes: the home of this great rabbi was practically bare! No pictures hung on the walls, and overturned milk crates sufficed for a table and chairs. Incredulous, the traveler asked him, "Where is your furniture?"/  The Chafetz Chaim replied, "Where\'s yours?" The traveler was surprised by this strange question. "Me?" he asked. "I\'m just passing through!" "So am I," responded the Chafetz Chaim. "I am also just passing through."/  * * *// SHOPPING SPREE/  One more example should make the point abundantly clear. Imagine that you\'ve won the grand prize on a game show: a shopping spree at Macy\'s. For 15 minutes, you will have the entire store to yourself, during which time whatever merchandise you collect will be yours for the rest of your life. Try to picture what you would look like during those 15 minutes./  Now, imagine how you would react if, in the course of your frenzied shopping, a friend were to tap you on the shoulder and say, "I\'d love to chat with you, just for two minutes. Can we go get a cup of coffee?" Most likely, you wouldn\'t even take the time to respond - or perhaps you\'d just shout, "No time - I\'ll explain later," as you dashed off to the next department./  This imaginary shopping spree is comparable to our experience in this world. We each have an individual expiration date, but until that date arrives, we are in a candy store of Torah and mitzvot, and whatever we collect is ours for eternity. If we truly lived with this awareness, we would have to be reminded to eat, drink and sleep. Our physical considerations would pale in comparison to the importance of stashing away goods for eternity, and we would be constantly on the lookout for opportunities to accumulate more spiritual "merchandise." I have yet to hear anyone on their deathbed say, "If only I\'d spent a few more hours at the office..."/  May we be blessed, as we move from place to place on our journeys through life, to focus on what is truly important and not get distracted by fleeting temptations. In this merit, may God soon redeem us from our exile and afford us the opportunity to be involved in purposeful, meaningful, spiritual endeavors forever.'},{ID:73,parshaId:44,vort:'This week we begin Deuteronomy, the last Book of the Torah, consisting of Moses\'s final words to the Jewish people before they enter the Land of Israel. In this week\'s parsha, Moses recalls certain infamous events of the previous 40 years, such as the incident with the spies. He repeats the words he spoke to the people at that time: "The Lord your God, has given {"natan"} the land to you. Go up and inherit it" {Deut. 1:21}./\r\n\r\nThis verse presents a few technical difficulties. First, why does Moses say that God has already given the land to the Jewish people? The Jews have not yet entered Israel, and thus have not officially taken possession of it. Why, then, is the verb "to give" in the past tense {"natan"}? Furthermore, why does Moses say, "Go up and inherit [the land]" if he knows that the Jews will have to wage war before inheriting it? It seems that Moses should have said, "Go up and wage war"!/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest a way of understanding the upcoming war based on the words Moses spoke to the nation immediately before the Splitting of the Sea: "God will wage war for you" {Exodus 14:14}. When God promises to wage war for the Jewish people, there is no doubt as to the outcome. Therefore, even though the people are now facing an imminent battle, it is a battle that God has commanded them to fight, so it is already considered a victory./\r\n\r\nThis explains Moses\'s statement, "God... has given the land to you." The land is essentially already in the possession of the Jewish people, even though they have yet to go to war against the Canaanite nations. This also explains why Moses says, "Go up and inherit [the land]." If the war is as good as won, the Jews have only to inherit the land that God has promised them. Perhaps this is why Moses concludes the verse by saying, "Do not be afraid." The outcome of the battle is guaranteed; there is nothing to be nervous about./\r\n\r\nA support to this interpretation appears later in the parsha, when Moses recalls the battle the Jewish people waged against Sichon, the Amorite king {Deut. 2:31-34}. First, God told Moses, "Go and inherit [Sichon\'s] land" {Deut. 2:31}. Then Sichon\'s army attacked the Jewish forces {Deut. 2:32}, after which God gave the Jews the victory {2:33}. The order of these verses illustrates our point. The Jewish people began to possess Sichon\'s territory even before Sichon attacked! When God does battle for us, victory is assured from the outset./\r\n\r\n                                                   * * *///\r\n                                               HOPE OF ISRAEL//\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war against Sichon, the Jewish people utterly destroyed all of Sichon\'s cities, along with the men, women and children {Deut. 2:34}. The word used for "men" in this verse is "m\'tim," a very unusual term. Why does Moses use this word rather than the more common term "anashim"?/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the word "m\'tim" be read as "maitim," meaning "dead people." In other words, when the Jewish forces captured Sichon\'s cities, the inhabitants were already considered "dead." This hint in the text emphasizes that God\'s promise guarantees the ultimate outcome./\r\n\r\nMaimonides explains at length that this is the Jewish perspective on every war we fight: "When the Jewish people enter into war, we rely on the Hope of Israel and its Savior [God], the One who redeems us from distressing times, and we know that we are waging war for the unification of God\'s Name. Place your soul in His hand and do not be afraid or panic... Anyone who wages war with all his heart and without fear, with the sole intention of sanctifying God\'s Name, will have no harm come to him and no evil will befall him..." {Hilchot Melachim, 7:15}./\r\n\r\nThe Book of Deuteronomy is also called "Mishneh Torah," implying a repetition of previous events. Similarly, Jewish history repeats itself. We don\'t know how current events in the Land of Israel will continue to unfold, but we know that, throughout the ages, Jews have put our trust in God that we will be victorious./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to witness the peace that comes from loving and respecting every human being, living in harmony, and serving God together.'},{ID:74,parshaId:45,vort:'This week\'s parsha is always read on the Shabbat following Tisha B\'Av. This Shabbat is known as "Shabbat Nachamu" {Shabbat of Consolation}, based on the opening words of the Haftorah: "Nachamu, nachamu, ami - Be consoled, my nation {Isaiah 40:1}. Shabbat Nachamu is intended to console us after the destruction of our Temple, since our Sages teach that if the Temple is not rebuilt in a given generation, it is as if the Temple were destroyed in that generation {Jerusalem Talmud, Yoma 1:1}./\r\n\r\nSince Parshat Va\'etchanan always coincides with Shabbat Nachamu, it seems logical that some type of "comfort" is found within the parsha itself. What comforting words does it share with us?\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, God tells the Jewish people {Deut. 4:20}, "I have taken you out of an iron furnace" {kur ha-barzel}. The expression "kur ha-barzel" refers to the Egyptian exile. We might wonder why the Torah describes Egypt with this particular phrase, when similar words could express the same idea. For example, a prophesy in the Book of Malachi {13:19} states, "Behold a day is coming, burning like an oven." It seems that the word "oven" would be an equally fitting description of Egypt. So why does this week\'s parsha specifically use the imagery of an iron furnace?/\r\n\r\nWe can shed light on this issue by examining Rashi\'s commentary on our verse. Rashi defines the word "kur" {furnace} as "a vessel within which gold is purified." We could suggest that Rashi is not merely translating the word "kur," but is also explaining why we refer to the Egyptian exile as a "kur" {furnace} and not a "tanur" {oven}. An oven is used for the everyday cooking and preparation of food. A furnace, on the other hand, has the specific function of refining gold. We can learn from here that God sent us into the Egyptian exile because He considers the Jewish people to be as precious as gold. No one bothers to refine ordinary rocks, because the result is worthless; however, people will expend great effort to refine gold, because we know that the outcome is valuable./\r\n\r\nSo too, God sent the Jewish people into the hottest of furnaces because He knew how valuable we would be when we emerged. God knew that the Jewish people would be molded by the process of exile and that, through that process, we could achieve extraordinary levels. Everyone knows that through adversity, greatness emerges./\r\n\r\nThis is how this week\'s parsha comforts us after the desolation of Tisha B\'Av. As a nation, we have certainly gone through many forms of "kur ha-barzel" during the two millennia since the destruction of the Holy Temple. Yet our experience in this "kur" is the surest indication that we are as precious as gold in God\'s eyes. Even as we yearn for redemption, we must realize that God will do whatever it takes to refine us, so that we can become as pure and as elevated as possible./\r\n\r\nMay we each recognize our intrinsic self-worth and utilize every golden opportunity to become all that we can be. In this way, may we merit the re-building of our Holy Temple in Jerusalem.'},{ID:75,parshaId:46,vort:'This week\'s parsha contains the verse, "...Not by bread alone does man live; rather, on all that comes from the mouth of God does man live" {Deut. 8:3}. We will return to this verse shortly, after we see a few other Torah sources about eating./\r\n\r\nIn Parshat Beshalach, Moses speaks to the Jewish people regarding the manna, saying, "Eat it today, for today is Shabbat; today you will not find it in the field" {Exodus 16:25}. The manna was the Jewish people\'s primary sustenance during their 40 years in the wilderness. Based on the three-fold repetition of the word "today" in this verse, the Talmud {Shabbat 117b} derives that we must eat three meals on Shabbat./\r\n\r\nWhen the day before Passover is Shabbat, bread may not be eaten for the third Shabbat meal. The Remah {Orach Chaim 444:1} states that, according to the Ashkenazi custom, egg matzah may not be eaten either. Instead, in this situation, fruit, meat and fish make up for the lack of bread or matzah. Furthermore, the Magen Avraham notes that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai used to spend the third Shabbat meal studying Torah, and this satisfied his obligation./\r\n\r\nWhere do we see that studying Torah can be an adequate substitute for eating a meal? The verse mentioned earlier from this week\'s parsha {"...Not by bread alone does man live; rather, on all that comes from the mouth of God does man live"} may explain this. The mitzvah of a Shabbat meal is not through eating "bread alone." We greatly enhance the meal by learning Torah - the Divine wisdom "that comes from the mouth of God."\r\n\r\nWe can suggest that this idea specifically refers to the third Shabbat meal. In the verse about the manna mentioned above, the third mention of the word "today" corresponds to the third meal: "Today you will not find [the manna] in the field." We can infer from here that we do not always find the nourishment for the third meal in the produce of the field. Rather, we can be nourished as well by using our mouths to speak words of Torah, as the verse says, "The matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it" {Deut. 30:14}./\r\n\r\nAmong certain circles, the third Shabbat meal tends to be neglected. This is a troubling oversight, since all three meals are an integral part of the mitzvah of Shabbat and are obligatory according to Jewish law. The Talmud {Shabbat 118a} teaches that our care in eating all three Shabbat meals will protect us from three calamities that precede the messianic era: the war of Gog and Magog {Armageddon}; the "birth pangs of Messiah" {severe disagreements among Torah scholars [Rashi]}; and the judgment of Gehenom. Each meal seemingly protects us from one of these three punishments./\r\n\r\n                                                 * * *////\r\n                                             THIRD MEAL////\r\n\r\nThe third Shabbat meal is traditionally referred to as Shalosh Seudos {literally, "three meals"}, or more accurately, Seudah Shlishit {"third meal"}. The siddur Yesodei Yeshurun, however, explains that Shalosh Seudos is actually a truer description of the meal. Eating the first two Shabbat meals is a mitzvah - but we are hungry anyway. It can therefore be difficult to tell whether we are eating these meals for God or just to satisfy our own hunger. Only once we reach the third meal {especially in the winter, when we sit down at the table again just an hour after finishing lunch} can we discern our true motivations for eating. When we push ourselves to eat the third meal, despite our lack of hunger, it is clear that we are eating only in order to fulfill a mitzvah. Our pure intentions for this meal are then retroactively applied to the first and second meals as well. The reward for all three meals is contained in the third - hence its traditional designation as Shalosh Seudos {"three meals"}./\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the weekday prayers, each of the three Amidah prayers on Shabbat is different. The Friday night Amidah mentions the creation of heaven and earth; the liturgy on Shabbat morning discusses Moses\'s bringing the Torah down from Mount Sinai; and the Amidah on Shabbat afternoon describes the messianic era, when God\'s unity will be universally recognized./\r\n\r\nThe commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains that each Shabbat meal corresponds to one of these monumental historical events. Thus, as we gather to eat the three delicious Shabbat meals, we also have the opportunity to digest their significance. On Friday night, we focus on strengthening our belief that God created the world. On Shabbat day, we celebrate receiving the Torah. And at the third meal, we tap into an energy of purity and sanctity that will characterize the messianic era. Our awareness of the potential of these times can help us make the most of every Shabbat./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed with the highest of Sabbaths - not just this week, but also when we eventually reach the messianic era, described as "a day that is entirely Shabbat." Through the mitzvah of strengthening ourselves in Shabbat, its meals, and what they represent, may we be spared the difficulty and upheaval of the End of Days, and soon merit to live in a world where every day will have the sanctity of Shabbat.'},{ID:76,parshaId:47,vort:'In the opening verse of this week\'s parsha, Moses speaks to the Jewish people and says, "See {re\'eh}, I have set before you today a blessing and a curse" {Deut. 11:26}. The word "re\'eh" seems out of place here. Moses is not showing anything to the people; he is merely informing them about the consequences of their actions! Why does the Torah present this information in terms of "seeing," when it would have made more sense to use the idea of "hearing"?/\r\n\r\nLater in the parsha, the verse instructs us "to do what is good and upright in the eyes of God" {Deut. 12:28}. Rashi {quoting the Midrash Sifri} divides this verse into two parts: the word "good" {tov} refers to doing good in the eyes of God, whereas the word "upright" {yashar} refers to acting righteously in the eyes of other people. This is a very puzzling comment. Since the verse itself links both of these qualities {"good" and "upright"} to God, how can the Midrash claim that the word "upright" refers to other people? This seems contrary to the literal meaning of the text!/\r\n\r\nA passage in the Talmud {Brachot 28b} will help us resolve both difficulties://\r\n\r\nThe students of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai came to visit him when he was on his deathbed. They gathered around their teacher and requested a blessing. Rabbi Yochanan replied, "May it be God\'s will that your fear of Heaven be as great as your fear of people." This unusual blessing surprised the students: "Is that all?" they exclaimed. It would seem that a person\'s fear of God should be even greater than his fear of people! Rabbi Yochanan responded: "You should know that when a person commits a crime, his first thought is always, \'Did anybody see me?\'"/\r\n\r\nThis Talmudic passage provides an insight into the Midrash\'s division of the verse in Parshat Re\'eh. The Torah counsels, "Do what is good and upright in the eyes of God." But how are we to know what is "good" in God\'s eyes? The seemingly superfluous word "upright" is included in the verse to teach us the following lesson. We do what is good in the eyes of God by imagining what our conduct would be if we were in the presence of important people. Acting righteously, with other people in mind, is a prerequisite to pleasing to the Divine. This interpretation does not contradict the literal meaning of the verse; rather, it teaches us an approach we must take in our daily lives to help ensure that we are doing what is "good in God\'s eyes."/\r\n\r\n                                             * * *////\r\n                                         VIVID IMAGE//\r\n\r\nNow we can understand the use of the word "re\'eh" in terms of this idea. The Talmud teaches, "Who is wise? One who sees the future" {Tamid 32a}. It is interesting that the Talmud does not attribute wisdom to one who knows the future. Instead, the word "see" is used. This teaches us an important lesson. A person who knows what will happen may not change his behavior - but a person who vividly sees, with his mind\'s eye, the potential outcome of his actions, may choose to act differently./\r\n\r\n{We all know that our time on earth is finite, yet this knowledge of our own mortality rarely spurs us to make positive changes in our lives. However, if we were to see, in our imagination, the actual moment of our death, that frightening vision of stretchers and paramedics would make us aware of our true priorities far more powerfully than mere knowledge!}/\r\n\r\nThis is why Moses uses the word "re\'eh" in addressing the Jewish people. Moses does not want the people simply to listen to his words - he wants them to vividly imagine the results of obeying or disobeying them./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with a dynamic imagination that will lead us to an awareness of God\'s Presence. May we use our vision to truly see the ramifications of our action, speech and thought so that we can live our lives according to what is good and upright in God\'s eyes.'},{ID:77,parshaId:48,vort:'The beginning of Parshat Shoftim cautions the judges of the Jewish people, "Do not take a bribe {shochad}" {Deut. 16:19}. The Talmud {Ketuvot 105b} asks, "What is shochad? It means SHE\'HU CHAD {that he is alone}."/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Gan Raveh explains this cryptic remark in light of another Talmudic passage {Shabbat 10a} that states, "Any judge who issues a true verdict is considered to be a partner with God in Creation." In other words, a judge who accepts a bribe cannot issue a true verdict, since the bribe will have swayed his perception of truth. Since his ruling will not be just, he can no longer be called God\'s partner in Creation. Therefore, the bribe {shochad} has led him to a state where he is alone {she\'hu chad}./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Ketuvot 105a} wonders what new idea we learn from the verse, "Do not take a bribe." If the phrase is trying to teach us not to acquit the guilty and accuse the innocent, this idea is stated explicitly elsewhere, "You shall not pervert judgment" {Deut. 16:19}. Rather, the Talmud explains that a judge must not take a bribe even if it is in order to acquit the innocent and accuse the guilty. Accepting a bribe is wrong even if the verdict issued is ultimately correct!/\r\n\r\nThis raises a problem. Earlier, it seemed that shochad led to the corruption of justice, which distanced the dishonest judge from God. Now it seems that shochad applies even if the judge issues a true verdict. How, then, can we say that he is considered to be chad {alone}? Ultimately, he did what was right!/\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this difficulty, we must return to the Talmudic statement we mentioned initially: "Any judge who issues a true verdict {emet l\'amito} is considered to be a partner with God in Creation." The commentator Divrei Chanoch wonders why the double expression emet l\'amito {literally, "truthful truth"} is used here, when the single word emet {truth} would seem to suffice. Once absolute truth has been reached, what could possibly make it truer?/\r\n\r\n                                             * * *//////\r\n                                       TRUTHFUL TRUTH///\r\n\r\nThe Divrei Chanoch explains, based on the Beit Yosef {Choshen Mishpat 1:2}, that even if the final ruling is true, a judge who accepts a bribe will still favor one party more than the other. This is a corruption, since the judge loves the party that gave him the bribe and hates the party that didn\'t. Although the ruling itself may be emet, the judge\'s emotions have been altered, so the verdict cannot be emet l\'amito. "Truthful truth" refers to the internal world as well, not merely an externally correct judgment./\r\n\r\nThe Divrei Chanoch therefore explains why a judge who accepts a bribe, yet issues a true verdict, is nevertheless considered to be "alone." In order to be a partner with God in Creation, a judge must be truthful through and through. Actions alone are insufficient; his emotions must also reflect his utter commitment to justice. We can learn from here that it is not enough just to act properly. We are expected to feel the right way, as well - to align our emotions with the will of God./\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentator Torat Avot, there are two levels of truth. The first level is intellectual, based on knowledge and reasoning. The second, higher level is emotional, drawn from the wisdom of the heart. This does not in any way dismiss the value of intellectual knowledge. However, it is crucial for the Torah learning that we acquire intellectually, to permeate our hearts emotionally. Torah study often changes the way we think - but we must be sure that it also changes the way we feel./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to reach inward and live a truly truthful life, by allowing Torah to penetrate our hearts and change our feelings. In this way, may we live up to the high standards of behavior that have been set for us, so that God will judge us favorably!'},{ID:78,parshaId:49,vort:'This week\'s parsha discusses the mitzvah of Shiluach HaKen - sending away the mother bird. The Torah states {Deut. 22:7} that on chancing upon a bird\'s nest on the way, "you should send the mother bird away and take the young for yourself - in order that it will be good for you and that you will have a long life." This guarantee of longevity is found elsewhere in the Torah concerning another mitzvah, that of honoring one\'s father and mother {Exodus 20:12}. Why do these specific commandments share a common reward?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Talmud {Brachot 33b} instructs us to silence a person who, in his prayers, requests, "Just as Your mercy, God, has reached the bird\'s nest, so may it reach us as well," as this is considered an improper way to pray. The Talmud, on the same page, asks why this is so. According to one opinion, the reason is that he is wrongly referring to God\'s commandments as merciful, when in fact they are simply decrees. Why is this mitzvah regarded as merely a decree from God, as opposed to a merciful instruction from God? Is it not a fact that we are being sensitive by sending the mother bird away prior to taking her young?/\r\n\r\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that a person\'s completeness in serving God is established only when he masters two diametrically opposed character traits, for instance the antithetical attributes of compassion and harshness. If a person possesses only one of the traits, for example in this case, compassion, it does not necessarily determine his righteousness - because the individual may simply be a naturally kind person and need not have worked on managing the emotion and directing it appropriately. If, however, he possesses both opposing traits and displays control in utilizing these conflicting emotions correctly, it proves that he has worked on managing his emotions, and for this he is considered a righteous person./\r\n\r\nThere are two mitzvot that symbolically represent these opposing traits: {1} honoring one\'s parents and {2} sending away the mother bird. The former mitzvah characterizes the quality of compassion: Tending to one\'s parents, particularly as they become older and require more help, demands much compassion and concern from the caregiver. The latter mitzvah of Shiluach HaKen represents the attribute of harshness, as sending away the mother bird will cause her much distress as she is forcibly parted from her young./\r\n\r\n{Maimonides supports the idea that this mitzvah is indeed not a merciful one and remarks that if the aim of the mitzvah was for the sake of being compassionate and merciful to the mother bird, God would have forbidden us to slaughter birds altogether!}/\r\n\r\n                                                * * *//\r\n                                          IDENTICAL REWARD////\r\n\r\nBased on this insight, we can understand why the mitzvot of sending the bird and honoring parents share the identical reward of longevity. The Vilna Gaon explains that longevity symbolically represents completion, as a long life is often associated with a full and complete life. Thus through these mitzvot a person can reach completeness as he learns to control and use these opposing emotions accordingly. A reward of longevity {which symbolically represents completeness} is therefore highly fitting and appropriate!/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that, according to the Vilna Gaon, performance of only one of these commandments is insufficient to deserve the promised reward. Only by doing both does a person become "complete," as he has demonstrated mastery over contradictory emotions in order to serve God with all parts of his being, and therefore merits the reward of long life./\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of two specific verses in Psalms highlights this further. Psalms 149:7 speaks of taking revenge on nations committed to our annihilation, and just two verses later it talks of God\'s "splendor to all His pious ones." The Vilna Gaon explains that this Psalm teaches us that although naturally pious people are kind and compassionate, they nevertheless know to take action and act harshly when the situation and circumstances are appropriate, as dictated by God and His Torah./\r\n\r\nIt is now obvious why the Talmud considers it improper if a person calls on God to show him mercy the way God displays mercy to the mother bird: A prayer of this nature is suggesting that this mitzvah represents a compassionate and merciful act when, in fact it is exactly the opposite! Shiluach HaKen is a harsh, even cruel, act and God instructs us in this mitzvah in order to teach us a lesson that our actions should all be for the sake of Heaven and not just because we are compelled by our instincts. Compassion and harshness have their place in the service of God and we are expected to work on, and use, both these emotions appropriately./\r\n\r\n                                                * * */////////\r\n                                           ABRAHAM\'S DEEDS/////\r\n\r\nBased on all this, the Vilna Gaon continues, we are able to understand a verse in Genesis 22:12 which states that at the binding of Isaac {the Akeida}, the angels said to Abraham that they "now know he has the fear of God." Albeit that the Akeida was the hardest test, yet why only at this stage did the angels "realize" that Abraham is a righteous person? Surely this was evident from the hospitality and kindness that he demonstrated earlier!/\r\n\r\nThe Vilna Gaon points out that although Abraham did perform righteous deeds, as far as the angels were concerned, his actions may have stemmed from a natural instinct to do kindness. At the final test of the Akeida, however, when Abraham was commanded to slaughter his youngest, most beloved son {a truly harsh and cruel act that he would naturally never have dreamed of doing}, he set out to act with all his mind, heart and soul, because God commanded him. It is this mastering and channeling of his emotions, for the sake of God, that confirmed to the angels how righteous and God-fearing Abraham really was./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to master the art of balance, demonstrating compassion whenever possible, and harshness whenever necessary. May we merit living a long and productive life, deserving of God\'s protection as a mother bird protects her young.'},{ID:79,parshaId:50,vort:'This week\'s parsha discusses the mitzvah of "first fruits." A Jew who owns land in Israel and grows produce on it - specifically, the seven species for which the Land of Israel is praised - must gather the first of his crop in a basket and take it to the Temple, where a special ceremony takes place {see Deut. 26:2}. This parsha is always read prior to the beginning of Slichot prayers for forgiveness preceding Rosh Hashana. What is the message of this parsha, and how does it help us prepare for Slichot?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Tanchuma 1} states that Moses saw prophetically that the Temple would be destroyed in the future, and that the mitzvah of the first fruits would no longer be able to be fulfilled. In response, Moses instituted three daily prayers to replace this service. The Midrash\'s statement is striking, since the Talmud {Brachot 26b} teaches that our three daily prayers were instituted by the Patriarchs. How can we understand this contradiction? Was it Moses or the Patriarchs who established our current system of prayer?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Torah teaches that a specific statement must be recited by the person bringing the first fruits: "Then you shall answer and say...\'An Aramean destroyed my forefather..." {Deut. 26:5}. Rashi {citing Sotah 32b} explains that the word "you shall answer" refers to calling out in a loud voice. How is this interpretation derived? According to the Siftei Chachamim, the literal meaning of "you shall answer" is logical only if another person has previously spoken, necessitating a response. In this instance, however, no one has spoken at all. Therefore, our Sages expl/ained the phrase "you shall answer" to mean that we must say the prescribed statement in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation raises a difficulty. The Talmud {Brachot 24b} teaches that a person who raises his voice in prayer is considered to have little faith in God! Rashi explains that loud prayers imply a lack of belief that God can hear a whisper just as clearly. In practice, Jewish law follows this opinion {Orach Chaim 101:2, Mishna Brura 7}. If we are not permitted to raise our voice in prayer, how can our Sages specifically require it at the time we bring the first fruits?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Chanukat HaTorah addresses this issue by stating that there are two categories of prayer. The first category is regular prayer, containing the three standard elements of praise, request and thanks. The second category is prayer that testifies explicitly that God hears our thoughts. There is an obvious difference between these two categories. It is forbidden to raise our voices if we are praying according to the first category, because the volume might be misconstrued as a lack of belief. However, if we pray according to the second category, and explicitly state that God hears our thoughts, then surely He can also hear our whispers! Thus, it is permitted to raise our voices, because doing so will not lead to any improper assumptions./\r\n\r\n                                              * * *//\r\n                                      TWO CATEGORIES OF PRAYER///\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand a seeming misstatement in the ceremony of the first fruits. The person bringing his produce is required to say, "An Aramean [Lavan] destroyed my forefather [Yaakov]." But historically, this is not true! If Lavan didn\'t kill Yaakov, why would the Torah command us to say that he did? Rashi explains {Deut. 26:5, based on Sifri and JT Peah 1:1} that Lavan wanted to destroy Yaakov and his entire family. Since, among the non-Jewish nations, evil thoughts have the same status as evil acts, Lavan\'s desire to kill Yaakov was considered an actual murder. Therefore, a Jew who explicitly states, "An Aramean destroyed my forefather" is effectively stating that God hears a person\'s thoughts! Therefore, the person falls under the second category of prayer, and is allowed to raise his voice./\r\n\r\nOnce we are permitted to raise our voice in prayer, it is actually preferable to do so. The Aruch HaShulchan {Orach Chaim 101:8} states that raising our voices in prayer awakens our hearts. Additionally, we can suggest that loud prayer helps free us of our inhibitions, which elevates the words we say./\r\n\r\nThe concept of two categories of prayer will resolve the problem of who instituted daily prayers as a replacement for the service of first fruits. Based on the Talmud {Eruvin 16b}, which teaches "These and those are the words of the living God," we can suggest that both Moses AND the Patriarchs established our daily prayer service. The Patriarchs instituted prayer according to the first category, in which it is forbidden to call out loudly. Moses instituted prayer according to the second category, in which we explicitly state God\'s omniscience./\r\n\r\nWe see that the Amidah, corresponding to the Patriarchs, is said silently. But when do we experience Moses\'s type of prayer? One example is the Slichot service, in which we ask God\'s forgiveness for not only our improper actions and speech, but even for inappropriate thoughts. Asking forgiveness for improper thoughts is tantamount to acknowledging that God is aware of them. Thus, it is permissible to raise our voices. Furthermore, according to some customs, Slichot are said immediately after the Amidah, thereby juxtaposing the Patriarchs {silent prayer} with Moses {heartfelt cries for forgiveness}./\r\n\r\nAt last we see how this week\'s parsha relates to Slichot. When we read about the prayer spoken over the first fruits, we prepare ourselves to call out to God. Slichot, too, are spoken out loud, in order to awaken our emotions. They belong to the second category of prayer - Moses\'s category - in which we are encouraged to raise our voices to God and arouse our hearts to higher levels of connection./\r\n\r\nMay we all raise our voices in prayer so that, through truly meaning and feeling what we say, we arouse ourselves to become closer to God. In this merit may we be completely forgiven, and deserve to hear the loud shofar blast symbolizing the building of the Third Temple, where we\'ll once again bring the first fruits.'},{ID:80,parshaId:51,vort:"The three keys to spiritual success.\nIn this /week'/s /parsha (/Deut. /30//:12), we are told that the Torah 'is not found in Heaven' (Lo BaShamayim Hee). The Talmud (Baba Metzia 59) relates a story that connects to this verse:\nThere was once a debate concerning the status of an oven's purity. It was dubbed the 'Snake Oven,' due to the amount of discussion 'coiled' around the topic, as a snake coils around its prey. Rabbi Eliezer maintained that the oven was pure, while the other Sages argued otherwise. To prove his viewpoint, Rabbi Eliezer said, 'If the law is like me, let this carob tree prove it' The tree suddenly uprooted itself and flew about the length of a football field. The Sages, unimpressed, commented that proof of Jewish law cannot be brought from a carob tree.\nRabbi Eliezer continued, 'If the law is like me, let this stream of water prove it,'' at which point the stream began to flow uphill, a truly miraculous event! Again, the Sages were unmoved and stated that Jewish law could not be verified through the water. So Rabbi Eliezer continued, 'If the law is like me, let the walls of this study hall prove it.' Suddenly, the walls began to cave in.\nAlthough the walls of the study hall caved inward out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer, they did not collapse completely, out of respect for Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages, but remained at a tilt. The Sages stated that we do not bring proof of Jewish law through the walls of a Beit Midrash. And Rabbi Yehoshua, one of the Sages, exclaimed to the walls, 'Why are you getting involved in a debate between the Sages?!\nWith the Sages still not persuaded, Rabbi Eliezer called to Heaven to prove his opinion correct. Immediately, a heavenly voice (Bat Kol) rang out, 'Why do you argue with Rabbi Eliezer? The law is like him at all times!'' To protest, Rabbi Yehoshua arose and cited the verse in this week's portion, Lo Bashamayim Hee - [Torah] is not in Heaven.' Since God gave the Torah to the Jewish people, at Mount Sinai, authority over Torah matters is here on Earth, not in Heaven!\nFurthermore, since the Torah states (Exodus 23:2) that we are to rule according to the majority, that in itself is explicit proof that in the case of the oven the law was in accordance with the consensus of Sages.\nSome time after this incident, Rabbi Nathan saw Elijah the Prophet and asked him how God had reacted at the conclusion of the 'Snake Oven' debate. He responded that God had (metaphorically) smiled and said, 'My children have been victorious over Me!'\nSeveral questions arise concerning this story: If the first sign (the uprooted carob tree) that Rabbi Eliezer revealed did not impress the Sages, why did he continue to convey more? Surely the Sages were not interested in proof from signs. And why did Rabbi Eliezer choose these specific signs? What do these items symbolize?\n* * *\n THE THREE KEYS\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that there are three keys to success in Torah:\n1. Histap'kut - Sufficiency, that is being content with one's (material) lot.n2. Anivut - Humility.\n3. Shkeida Raba - Diligence.\nThere are several sources where we learn of the importance of Histap'kut in acquiring Torah. For instance, the Talmud says (Avot 6:4) that 'the way of Torah is eating bread with salt, drinking a measured amount of water, and sleeping on the ground' - in other words, where a person could handle, if necessary, a life where physical needs reach only the most basic level.\nFurthermore, the Talmud (Brachot 17b) relates that every day a voice is heard from Mount Sinai, saying,'The whole world is sustained through the merit of My (God's) child, Chanina, who sustains himself on a measure of carob from one Shabbat to the next,' implying that Rabbi Chanina's greatness was achieved by subsisting on a bare minimum.\nThis could be a reason why Mount Sinai is also referred to as Chorev (Exodus 33:6), as it has exactly the same letters as the word Charuv - carob. The way to acquire Torah, given at Chorev, is by being able to make do with a minimal amount of material comforts.\nThe second key which the Vilna Gaon mentions - humility - is derived from the Talmud (Ta'anit 7a, citing Isaiah 55:1) which compares the Torah to water. Just as water runs from high places and comes to rest in low places, so too Torah moves away from 'high' or haughty people and resides in \"low,\" humble people. The importance of this attribute is emphasized in the Talmud (Eruvin 13b) which states that the law is always like Hillel, who was known for his humility, as opposed to Shamai, even though the latter was intellectually superior. The third key - diligence - is highlighted in the Talmud (Eruvin 21b-22a) which states that Torah is found among those who rise early and stay late in the study hall. Diligence in Torah necessitates dedicating much time and energy to it's study, and is of paramount importance for success in becoming a Torah scholar./\r\n\r\n[We could suggest that these three keys are hinted at in the three blessings that we recite prior to studying Torah (see Brachot 11b). The first blessing, La'asok BeDivrei Torah - 'to engage, or toil over the words of Torah,' corresponds to the attribute of diligence, as much time, effort and dedication is required for success in this area. The second blessing, 'VeHa'arev Na', where we ask God to make the Torah sweet for us, refers to Histap'kut, as happiness and sweetness are achieved by means of being satisfied with one's material lot. Finally, the third blessing, 'Notein HaTorah', where we mention 'the One who gives us the Torah', corresponds to the trait of humility, as we humbly recognize that we do not take the Torah from God but rather, that God chooses to whom He gives the Torah. It is therefore fitting that prior to learning Torah, we recite these blessings, to remind us of the three ways to achieve success in our studies.]\n * * *\n THE THREE PROOFS\nWe can now understand the answer to the third question posed earlier, regarding why Rabbi Eliezer used the specific items of a carob tree, water and study hall as signs to verify his halachic decision, and why Rabbi Eliezer continued to bring more signs even after the Sages were unmoved by the first sign.\nThrough the carob tree (symbolizing Histap'kut), Rabbi Eliezer hinted to the Sages that he possessed the attribute of being content with his physical lot. He assumed that his acquisition of this key to Torah would serve as confirmation of his accurate understanding of the law. The Sages, however, were unimpressed, so Rabbi Eliezer thought to show his possession of the majority of keys to Torah. He therefore proceeded to the next sign, using water, which symbolizes humility, as a proof that he had also attained the second key to Torah.\nAgain, however, the Sages were not swayed, so Rabbi Eliezer realized that he must show that he has acquired all the keys to Torah. He therefore brought the third sign, where the walls of the study hall began to collapse, hinting that he possessed the attribute of diligence. Surely, after proving that he had acquired all three keys, the Sages would admit that his understanding of Halacha must be correct?\nFinally, once Rabbi Eliezer realized that even all three keys would not impress the Sages, he called upon Heaven to verify his conclusion. A heavenly voice was heard, validating all of Rabbi Eliezer's halachic rulings, but Rabbi Yehoshua, still undeterred, promptly arose and exclaimed, Lo BaShamyim Hee - 'Torah is not in Heaven!\nA Midrash helps us understand why even the voice from Heaven did not sway the Sages to accept Rabbi Eliezer's decision. The Midrash (Bereishit Raba 8:5) relates that when God wanted to create Man, some angels were in agreement, while others opposed the idea. This scenario is hinted to in Psalms 80:11 which says, 'Kindness and Truth have met.' The Midrash states that Chesed (kindness) went to God, as it were, and told Him to create Man because he will perform many good deeds. However, Emet (truth) claimed that Man will be filled with falsehood and should therefore not be created. God took Truth, says the Midrash, and cast it to Earth. (As it says in Daniel 8:12, 'And it shall cast Truth to the ground,' and in Psalms 85:12, 'Truth grows from the ground.')\nWhy did Truth claim to God that Man was unworthy of being created? The Vilna Gaon suggests it was due to the fact that Man, with his limited intellectual capacity, would not have the ability to fully recognize Truth. Thus to circumvent this claim, God cast Truth to the Earth, enabling Man to access it - and thus worthy of being created!\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that Torah is the truth which God cast to Earth (Torat Emet - see Malachi 2:6). This is why Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages, even after hearing the heavenly voice thundering that Rabbi Eliezer's conclusion is correct, were undeterred. They recognized that Truth, the will of God, lies not in Heaven, but here on Earth, with the word of God that was already handed to us at Mount Sinai, in the Torah.\nWe could suggest that is why God smiled and said, 'My children have been victorious.' In effect the oven incident was a test from God to see whether the Sages would concede under pressure from the signs (particularly the heavenly voice) and accept the validity of Rabbi Eliezer's ruling, or whether they would stand firm with the Truth of Torah. The Sages succeeded, and thus guaranteed the eternity of the Torah in the world, because the only way that Torah can be perpetuated down the generations is through the teachings of our Sages who hold the keys to the truth. (The words 'victory' and 'eternity' share the same root, netzach.)\nThe real bearers of Truth are those connected to Torah. Our tzaddikim individuals with fully refined characters and giants in Torah wisdom, hold the keys to the will of God. We must not doubt nor fear the decisions and advice of our Sages, but follow them wholeheartedly, as we are told in Deut. 17:11, because we recognize that it is they who know the truth.r\nAnd with this, may we all merit the keys to spiritual success!"},{ID:81,parshaId:52,vort:'This week\'s parsha is always read close to Rosh Hashana, which indicates it has a connection to this great and awesome day. How does this week\'s portion help prepare us for the Day of Judgment?/\r\n\r\nI find that many of us are filled with trepidation as Rosh Hashana approaches. We know that we are about to enter the courtroom where our fates for the year - regarding health, finances, spouse, children, etc. - will be written and sealed. The seriousness of this time of year often causes us to scramble for "tricks" that will guarantee a sweet future for ourselves. I would like to share one fundamental idea that, although simple to put into practice, can have far-reaching results in our lives./\r\n\r\nIn order to positively impact our future, it is crucial that we learn how to be "defense attorneys" on behalf of the Jewish people. The Talmud (Sotah 8b) teaches that the way we measure other people is the way that we are measured by God. In other words, if we refrain from criticism and accusations, and instead are careful to say only positive things about our fellow Jews, God will reciprocate in kind. We must learn to emphasize the good we see in Jewish individuals, communities, and in the nation as a whole, if we are to create a positive impression in the upper worlds./\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate this idea on Rosh Hashana by blowing the shofar. The holiness and purity of the shofar blast causes many of us to feel chills up and down our spines, or even to be moved to tears. This reaction is no coincidence. Our mystical tradition teaches that the sound of a shofar is, in fact, the collective voice of the Jewish people. No matter who we are or what we do, quivering deep inside of us is a pure and holy voice that is calling out to God and wanting to fulfill His will./\r\n\r\nKeeping this thought in mind can add a new dimension to the way we listen to the shofar this year. The sound of the shofar testifies that every Jew is a beautiful person, who, deep down, wants to do the right thing. If we can cultivate this awareness, and lovingly excuse other people\'s mistakes, then we will succeed in defending the Jewish people - whereupon God will reciprocate by accentuating our own positive behavior and finding justifications for our own mistakes./\r\n\r\nOne hint to this idea can be seen in Deut. 29:17, "Lest there be among you a root that produces haughtiness and wormwood" (Pen yaish bachem shoresh poreh rosh v\'la\'anah). The Mayana Shel Torah points out that the initial letters of the last four words of this verse (SH-oresh, P-oreh, R-osh, V-la\'anah) form an acronym of the word SHOFAR. In his view, this teaches us that the shofar blasts can remove any bad "root" that may be found within us./\r\n\r\nWe could also suggest an additional understanding of this verse. Even if our actions, speech, and thoughts have been negative, we still contain within us the holy and pure sound of a shofar that is calling out to be close to God./\r\n\r\nIt is important to defend the Jewish people by speaking positively about others instead of articulating their shortcomings. Involving ourselves in this exercise is the ideal preparation for Rosh Hashana, since the primary mitzvah of the day is the blowing of the shofar, which reminds us of our inner purity and holiness. May we be blessed this year to see only the positive and to recognize the shofar\'s voice hidden inside each and every one of us, so that we all receive an overabundant downpour of happiness, health, and wealth.'},{ID:82,parshaId:53,vort:'The Shabbat between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur is called is Shabbat Shuva (the Shabbat of Return)./\r\n\r\nThe Amidah of the High Holiday prayers contains the prayer, "You chose us from all the nations, You loved us and You desired us." Although this prayer is phrased in the past tense, it also implies that God continually chooses, loves, and desires the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nThe commentator Dover Shalom explains that the three expressions used in this prayer correspond to three levels of love. The lowest level is when we are loved because we are better than the other available options. Although we may be flawed, we are superior in comparison to the alternatives. The middle level is when we are loved because we are inherently good. The highest level is when we are loved unconditionally, for no reason at all. If there was a reason, it would be the reason that was loved, not us!/\r\n\r\nThe phrase "You chose us from all the nations" corresponds to the lowest level of love, when we are loved only in comparison to the alternative options. The Talmud (Avodah Zara 2b, on Deut. 33:2) teaches that God initially offered the Torah to the nations of the world, all of whom refused to accept it. Only the Jewish people eagerly responded, "We will do and we will hear!" (Exodus 24:7). Based on this positive response, God gave the Torah to us./\r\n\r\n[The Jews could therefore more accurately be called the Choosing People, not the Chosen People. We chose God first, and He reciprocated. From the Jewish perspective, God will choose anyone who chooses Him.]/\r\n\r\nThe phrase "You loved us" corresponds to the second level of love, when we are loved due to our intrinsic goodness. Not only are we preferable over other options; we are actually inherently lovable! Finally, the phrase "You desired us" corresponds to the highest level of love: inexplicable, absolute love that does not depend on reason./\r\n\r\nThe love between God and the Jewish people is compared to the love between a husband and a wife. The Mishnah (Kiddushin 1:1) teaches that there are three ways for a marriage to legally take effect: through a monetary transaction, a contract, or consummation. God married the Jewish people in all three ways. The Egyptian riches that washed ashore after the Jewish people crossed the Sea represent a monetary transaction (see Sefer HaMakneh on Kiddushin, Pischa Zeira). The Jewish people received our marriage contract at Mount Sinai, when God gave us the Torah; and our marriage was consummated during the time that the Jewish people lived within the privacy of the Divine Clouds of Glory./\r\n\r\n                                                  * * */\r\n                                           THREE LEVELS OF LOVE//\r\n\r\nWe can understand these three conditions for marriage as representing the three levels of love. God does not fulfill just one or two of these conditions; He sends us an outpouring of love, showing that He wants to connect with us in every possible way. The mitzvah of tefillin, in which a strap is wrapped three times around the middle finger, also expresses this idea. With each loop, we recite a verse beginning with the words, "I am betrothed to you" (Hoshea 2:21-22). The three loops that are formed look like three rings, representing marriage and the three levels of love. Every day, on an ongoing basis, God chooses us, loves us and desires us./\r\n\r\nThe preface to the Otzer Tefillot states that the main thrust of the High Holiday prayers is for God to reveal Himself to all nations and peoples, thereby eliminating the desecration of His name and increasing its sanctification. Perhaps our Sages chose to word the prayers this way so that we could attempt to reciprocate God\'s love and devotion to us. On Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, when our very lives are hanging in the balance, the greatest demonstration of love is our ability to rise above our personal concerns and devote ourselves solely to the revelation of God\'s glory. When God sees that we are mature enough to disregard our own needs and put His will above all else, He will do anything for us. This is the best way to secure for ourselves a sweet new year./\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our intentions must be sincere. The Talmud (Baba Kama 92a) teaches that a person who prays on behalf of another when he himself needs the same thing will be answered first. This does not mean to say that two poor people can make a plan to pray for each other so that they\'ll both get answered fast! In such a scenario, neither person is actually praying for the other; each is praying for himself, while using the other person as a device. The same is true with our intentions in the High Holiday prayers. We must not fool ourselves into thinking we are praying for the manifestation of God\'s glory, when really we just want to guarantee a good year for ourselves. Our ability to transcend our personal concerns is precisely what allows God to fulfill them./\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Day of Judgment, may we learn how to take ourselves out of the center and focus on God, and through this ultimate demonstration of love, may we be inscribed in the Book of Good Life.'},{ID:83,parshaId:54,vort:"Five ways that the Torah brings us joy./\r\n\r\nJon Krakauer describes reaching the top of Mount Everest in his book, Into Thin Air:/\r\n\r\n\u201cStraddling the top of the world, one foot in China and the other in Nepal, I cleared the ice from my oxygen mask, hunched a shoulder against the wind and stared absently down at the vastness of Tibet. I understood on some dim, detached level that the sweep of earth beneath my feet was a spectacular sight. I\u2019d been fantasizing about this moment, and the release of emotion that would accompany it, for many months. But now that I was finally here, actually standing on the summit of Mount Everest, I just couldn\u2019t summon the energy to care.\u201d (Jon Krakauer, Into Thin Air, p.5)/\r\n\r\nI was so startled by his description I had to read the paragraph a few times. It shook me up that a person could work for years training for a climb like this, dreaming about standing on the top of that mountain, looking out at the thousands and thousands of feet that he had found a way to rise above and be too tired to care./\r\n\r\nBut this happens often in life. We imagine that once we reach our destination, we will be ecstatic. We fantasize about that moment of happiness, but it is elusive, falling so easily out of our grasps, disappointing us just at the moment when we are straddling the top of the world.\r\n\r\nHow can we find and hold onto joy in this world without it slipping out of our hands? The holiday of Simchat Torah provides an answer. As we dance with the Torah, we bask in the unique, eternal happiness that only Torah can bring into our lives. \u201cIt is a tree of life for those who grasp it\u201d (Proverbs 3:18).\r\n\r\nHere are five ways that Torah brings us this lasting joy and life.////\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It gives us higher goals. The highest predictor of a person\u2019s lasting happiness is a goal that transcends himself. All of our personal goals, however important they may be, are part of a greater mission that all Jews share \u2013 to bring light to the world, to honor God\u2019s Name, to pass on our sacred traditions. The Torah gives us higher goals to strive for./\r\n\r\n2. It shows us how to be grateful. Most people understand why gratitude increases our happiness levels, but we don\u2019t necessarily know how to feel grateful on a daily basis. The Torah shows us how to be grateful several times each day. With prayer three times a day, with blessings over food and mitzvot. It imbues within us a constant awareness that we are receiving goodness and kindness from the Source of all life from the moment we open our eyes in the morning./\r\n\r\n3. It teaches us hope. Life is hard and often unpredictable. Many of us have different challenges that make it difficult to see a way forward. But the Torah teaches us that nothing is impossible. That God never gives us circumstances that we can\u2019t handle. That tomorrow will be brighter. That redemption is in our future. That we are not struggling in vain./\r\n\r\n4. It connects us. In a world where so many are lonely and dependent upon virtual company, the Torah pulls us each out of our isolation. It shows us how to set up communities and bring people together. It teaches us that we need each other. It helps us give even when we\u2019re not sure how. It connects grandparents to their grandchildren. It bridges the cultural gaps that so often divide us. It gives us a common language and a shared truth. It connects us to each other./\r\n\r\n5. It gives us flow. Our happiest moments occur when we are in the \u201cflow,\u201d completely engaged and absorbed by an activity we are doing. We transcend our physical and emotional limitations by immersing ourselves in the energy of the moment. Torah gives us this sense of flow when we are doing a mitzvah that is challenging for us but within our grasps. We visit the sick even when hospitals make us nervous. We invite the widow from across the street to Shabbos dinner even though we aren\u2019t in the mood for guests. We give tzedakah even though we are anxious about our finances. We choose to overcome a limitation inside of us and move forward even when we have to push ourselves to do so./\r\n\r\nBut the Torah also gives us this sense of flow through song and dance. This is the flow of Simchat Torah, celebrating the Torah that teaches us how to transcend our limits, how to be happy, how to be connected. How to sing songs that weave circles into circles that climb beyond the dancers themselves. The words that we sing bring us back to the core of who we are. The higher goals, the gratitude, the hope, the sheer joy of connecting to our Creator. For this moment He created us. For this joy He created the world. It is a happiness that won\u2019t slip away whether we are straddling the top of the world or just beginning our climb. It is in fact right there in our arms \u2013 the gift of the Torah that He gives to us. A happiness, a joy, that dances beyond itself."}];var H=function(){var
