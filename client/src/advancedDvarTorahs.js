    vort: "\"Rebbe Yitzchak said, '[God] need only have begun the Torah from 'This month shall be to you\" which is the first Commandment which Israel was commanded. For what reason did it begin with 'Bereishit'?... So that if the nations of the world will say to Israel, 'You are bandits, for you conquered the lands of the seven nations' Israel will say to them, 'The whole earth belongs to the Holy One, Blessed is He; He created it and He gave it to the one found proper in His eyes. By His wish, He gave it to them, and by His wish, He took it from them and gave it to us.'\" {Rashi, Bereishit 1:1}\r\n\r\nRashi opens his monumental commentary on the Torah, quoting Rebbe Yitzchak, who tells us that the Torah should have begun with the first mitzvah of sanctifying the new moon, and it only opened with the story of Creation and the subsequent events in order to teach us that the Jewish people have a God-given right to the land of Israel. The commentators ask why this point is so significant to the extent that the order of the Torah is drastically changed because of it.\r\n\r\nThe Levush Haorah answers that if it is true that the Jewish people stole the land of Eretz Yisrael then the whole Torah is undermined because in the Torah there are mitzvot prohibiting stealing and of encroaching on the property of another person {hasagat gevul}. Accordingly, the nations of the world will say that the Jews who claim to follow the Torah do not keep to its commands because they stole the land from the Seven Canaanite nations. And if the Jewish people will answer that God allowed them to steal it from the nations, then that is even more problematic as it demonstrates that even God Himself, does not, so to speak, observe His own commandments such as 'do to not steal' and hasagat gevul. This would cause a great Chillul Hashem {desecration of God's name} and undermine the whole message of the Torah.\r\n\r\nRebbe Yitzchak explains that the Torah addresses this argument, saying that there is no thievery here at all as God created the whole world and He determines who owns which land; It was His will that the nations have it at first, and it was His decision to take it from them and give it to the Jewish people.\r\n\r\nThe Levush Haorah teaches us a fundamental lesson with this explanation; Chillul HaShem is so serious that it is necessary to alter the nature of the Torah in order to avoid this possibility. This is because the whole purpose of Creation is Kiddush HaShem, the sanctification of God's name, the antithesis of Chillul HaShem. This is expressed in Pirkei Avos: \"Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He only created for His honor.\" The Mishna is teaching us the purpose in our lives should be to elevate God in the eyes of the world. The exact opposite of this is Chillul HaShem - acting in such a way that causes people to see the Torah or the Creator in a negative light, That is why it is so important that the Torah immediately assert the God-given right of the Jewish people to own Eretz Yisrael. Thus the Torah begins with a vital message for all of us - just like God is extremely careful to be seen to be consistent with His Torah, so too we must be careful that our actions also be consistent with the mitzvot of the Torah.",

    vort: 'This week\'s Torah portion opens with the following statement: "Noah was an ISH {man} TZADDIK {righteous person} TAMIM {who was completely righteous}" (Genesis 6:9). The word ISH is a compliment in its own right, and the additional descriptions heap honor upon honor on Noah. No other personality is described with so many consecutive praises in one verse!\r\n\r\nThe first verse in the Book of Psalms teaches: "Fortunate is the man {ISH} who has not gone in the counsel of the wicked, and has not stood in the path of sinners, and has not sat in the company of scoffers." The Midrash Socher Tov, in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, comments that the phrase "Fortunate is the man {ISH}," refers to Noah, since Noah is called ISH, as in our Parsha.\r\n\r\nWhy is Noah described as "fortunate"? According to the Midrash, Noah was fortunate in that he did not follow the ways of the three categories of people {wicked, sinners, scoffers} cited in Psalms. These three negative categories correspond to the three generations that arose in the world over the course of Noah\'s lifetime: the generation of Enosh {Adam\'s grandson, who initiated the practice of idolatry}; the generation of the Flood {immersed in immoral behavior}; and the generation of the dispersion {who built the Tower of Babel in order to wage war against God}. It was Noah\'s good fortune that he did not go in the path of any of these three generations.\r\n\r\nThe Midrash teaches us that Noah spent his entire life surrounded by evil and wickedness, yet he managed to make himself into one of the most righteous people who ever lived. This is a remarkable feat. How is it possible for a person to maintain such a high level of spirituality while surrounded by an environment of depravity and corruption?\r\n\r\nA passage from the Talmud will help us resolve this question. Ben Zoma says, "Who is a wise person? One who learns from everyone" {Avot 4:1}. This is a strange statement. It seems reasonable for us to want to learn from righteous people - but what is wise about learning from the wicked?\r\n\r\nThe Berditchiver Rebbe remarks that righteous people are able to perceive positive qualities in even the most negative situations. From everything they encounter, they learn how to serve God better.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a righteous person were to witness someone passionately engaged in sinning, he would recognize and appreciate the tremendous motivating power of passion. However, instead of taking that power and using it to accomplish negative goals, the righteous person would redirect it for a meaningful purpose. The correct channeling of passion has the potential to change rote, sterile performance of God\'s mitzvot into mitzvah observance driven by enthusiasm and fire! {Kedushat Levi, end of Parshat Bereishit}\r\n\r\nNoah epitomized this ability to channel negative forces toward a higher purpose. A hint to this idea is found in his name. The Torah tells us {Genesis 6:8} that Noah found CHEN {favor} in the eyes of God. The name NOAH {nun-chet}, when reversed, spells CHEN {chet-nun}! Noah found favor in the eyes of God by mastering the art of reversal. He had the ability to redirect every energy from a negative goal to a positive one.\r\n\r\nThis is why a wise person learns from everyone. Instead of being corrupted by his evil generation, Noah used it as an opportunity for spiritual growth. He had the "best" teachers available! All Noah had to do was learn to take their ingenuity, arrogance, passion, jealousy, and zeal, and use them in a productive, constructive way to get closer to God.\r\n\r\nMay we all learn how to transform the power of every energy and drive into positive action in order to become the best we can possibly be.',

    vort: 'The Talmud (Taanit 4a) teaches that, although the Jewish people made an improper request, nevertheless, God answered them properly. The Jewish people\'s request is derived from a biblical verse in which the people say, "Let us know and strive to know God like the morning that is found with certainty; may God come down to us like the rain." {Hoshea 6:3}\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, God responds to this request with a more appropriate offer. Since rain is not always desirable, God answers the people based on another verse: "I will be like dew for the Jewish people." {Hoshea 14:6}\r\n\r\nWe see from this dialogue that the people want God to be like rain for them, whereas God suggests acting like dew for them. What is the significance of this give and take? What is the difference between rain and dew?\r\n\r\nThe Shem MiShmuel provides a beautiful explanation of this passage based on the unique qualities of rain and dew. When rain falls on produce in the fields, it completely saturates the earth. Dew, on the other hand, has a gentler influence. Dew provides a light layer of moisture as "encouragement," enabling produce to moisturize itself.\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can understand the give and take in the Talmudic passage we quoted above. When the Jewish people are striving to become more spiritual, they cry out to God: "Make us holy! Make us into everything we can be!" God\'s response to the people redirects their desire for growth. Instead of God acting like rain and saturating the people with externally imposed demands, He offers to act like dew and encourage their own inner process of spiritual development. With dew, God can gently show the people their personal reservoirs of unlimited spiritual strength, thereby enabling them to take themselves to levels they never dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nThe Midrash, which discusses the first verse in this week\'s Parsha, touches on this idea as well {Bereishit Rabba 39:3 on Genesis 12:1}. The Midrash quotes Rabbi Brachya, who finds a reference to Abraham in the verse from Song of Songs {8:8}, "We have a young sister {achot}." This is a strange comment. Why would Abraham be considered a sister? Rabbi Brachya explains that the Hebrew word for sister, achot, can be interpreted to mean she-icha - that he joined and connected all the people of the world.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this refers to Abraham\'s "connecting" all the people of the world to Divine service. At the end of the Midrash, Bar Kapara adds that joining people to God can be compared to one who joins the two sides of a ripped garment. How are we to understand this final comment? How is Abraham\'s joining people to God similar to joining the sides of a ripped garment? And how is the joining of a ripped garment different from joining two separate pieces of cloth that had not been ripped?\r\n\r\nWe can resolve these questions based on the teaching of the Shem MiShmuel that we mentioned earlier. The Midrash does not say explicitly that Abraham joined the people of the world to God; it simply says that he joined all the people of the world together. We could therefore suggest that Abraham facilitated people\'s connection to THEMSELVES, by making them aware of the spark of holiness within them. The first step in achieving our spiritual potential is to recognize that we contain tremendously rich inner resources. Once we are aware of the Divine spark within, we have the ability to access it and to grow to new spiritual heights.\r\n\r\nThe Tifferet Shmuel uses this idea to explain how Abraham was able to convert so many people to monotheism. Abraham\'s genius was in showing people how extraordinary they were already! Through seeing people\'s inner spark of beauty and goodness, Abraham could show them that acting in negative ways was not consistent with their true selves. He could therefore encourage them to return to their pure essence.\r\n\r\nThis explains Bar Kapara\'s metaphor of the ripped garment. Abraham saw that everyone was originally created whole and holy, just as the two sides of the ripped garment were originally one. Abraham was successful at joining together the people of the world because he saw people\'s potential for wholeness so clearly. He could therefore encourage them to connect themselves to who they had been before they were ripped - to return to their true inner selves.\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to drink the dew of success by awakening ourselves to the purity and greatness of our innermost potential!',

    vort: 'Parshat Vayeira is an opportunity to learn from the extraordinary actions of our patriarch, Abraham.\r\n\r\nThe Noam Elimelech teaches that the primary aspect of a mitzvah is not its technicalities and details, but rather the love we put into its performance. This does not mean to say that we should disregard the technicalities; on the contrary, we must perform them accurately and to the best of our ability. Nevertheless, when God weighs the two components of a mitzvah, He considers the love we put into its performance to be greater than even the act itself.\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {in Netivot Shalom} cites a proof of this idea. The Talmud {Brachot 6a} wonders what the phrase in Malachi {3:16} means when it states, "u\'l\'choshvei shemo" - "and to those who think about God\'s Name." Rav Ashi explains that a person who intended to perform a mitzvah, yet was prevented from doing so for reasons beyond his control, is nevertheless credited with having performed it. This is because "choshvei shemo" - the person was thinking about His Name.\r\n\r\nIf God is present in our thoughts, and we yearn and desire to fulfill His will, we are credited with performing mitzvot even when the acts themselves did not come to fruition. The desire to fulfill the Divine will is considered the primary element of the mitzvah.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this idea does not hold true in the reverse. The Tikkunei Zohar {Tikkun 10} teaches that a mitzvah performed with all its intricacies and technicalities, yet without love, does not fly upward. This is because the fundamental ingredient - love - is absent.\r\n\r\nOur tradition teaches that God tested Abraham 10 times {Avot 5:3}. Although Abraham had many extraordinary character traits, it was his overwhelming love for God that enabled him to pass his tests. In Isaiah {41:8}, God describes Abraham as "Avraham ohavi" - "Abraham, the one who loves Me." Abraham\'s tremendous love for God enabled him to carry out the Divine will time after time, even in exceptionally challenging situations.\r\n\r\nWe see this idea in the Talmud\'s statement that love breaks all norms {Sanhedrin 105b; see also Bereishit Rabba 55:8}. When a person is truly in love, there is nothing he wouldn\'t do for his beloved.\r\n\r\nAbraham demonstrates this quality in this week\'s Parsha when God commands him to sacrifice his son, Isaac. The Torah tells us that Abraham got up early in the morning to perform God\'s command, even performing menial tasks such as saddling his own donkey and chopping wood for the sacrifice {Genesis 22:3}! Abraham\'s zeal and willingness to perform such tasks himself, instead of appointing one of his many servants to do so, was a manifestation of his incredible love for God.\r\n\r\nThis idea helps us understand why Abraham chopped the wood for the sacrifice as soon as he awoke from his prophecy. A more sensible plan might have been to wait until he and Isaac arrived at Mount Moriah, thereby saving himself three days of schlepping! According to the Noam Elimelech, however, this was not a logistical oversight. Abraham prepared the wood immediately to demonstrate his love for God. When we love someone, we want to do their bidding immediately, with our own two hands, no matter how difficult the task may be. This was the type of relationship that Abraham had with God - a relationship of love that breaks all norms.\r\n\r\nMay we use the inspiration of Abraham to love God, in order to succeed in passing our tests in life. And may we merit to see the reciprocation of that love with the final redemption of our people.',

    vort: "This week's portion begins with the death of our matriarch, Sarah. The Torah tells us {Genesis 23:2} that upon Sarah's passing, Abraham eulogized her and wept. According to our tradition, the letter kaf in the word \"v'livkota\" {\"and he wept over her\"} is written smaller than the other letters in the word. The commentator Kohelet Isaac understands this small kaf as an indication that Abraham cried only a little bit over Sarah's passing.\r\n\r\nWe might find this comment surprising. Surely Abraham was devastated over the loss of his beloved wife. Why would he cry only a little bit?\r\n\r\nThis question becomes even stronger when we look at Rashi's comment {Genesis 23:2} regarding the juxtaposition of the binding of Isaac and the death of Sarah. According to Rashi, when the news reached Sarah that Abraham had brought Isaac as an offering to God, Sarah was so overwhelmed that she died. How can we understand Abraham weeping only minimally in such a situation? Not only did his wife pass on; it seems that, indirectly, his own actions actually killed her!\r\n\r\nA deeper examination of Abraham's motives will help us resolve this troubling question. When Abraham returned from Mount Moriah to find that Sarah had died, he could easily have regretted following God's will. This would have been an understandable reaction; after all, his obedience to God resulted in the death of his beloved wife! Yet Abraham understood the tremendous power of regret to undo the effect of past actions. When repentance is used positively, as part of the teshuva process, it has the ability to erase our misdeeds. But repentance can also erase the reward we receive for performing mitzvot. Had Abraham regretted bringing Isaac as an offering, countless future generations would have lost the ability to draw from the merit of his actions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Abraham cried only a little bit over the passing of his beloved wife to show that, despite the challenges, he did not regret having performed the Divine will. He knew that there are no negative consequences to performing mitzvot wholeheartedly and that his actions could therefore not have been the true cause of Sarah's death. In overcoming this test of faith, Abraham preserved the merit of the binding of Isaac as a powerful spiritual inheritance for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis idea also helps us understand a puzzling passage from the evening prayers. Before reciting the Amidah of the evening Ma'ariv, we beseech God to remove the Satan from before us and from after us {va'haser satan mil'faneinu u'mei'achoreinu}. What does this strange phrasing signify?\r\n\r\nThe Satan is the evil inclination {Yetzer Hara} that challenges our connection to God. The Satan \"before us\" is the Yetzer Hara that tries to prevent us from performing mitzvot and following the Divine will. If the Yetzer Hara does not succeed in convincing us to give up before we've even started, however, it tries again after the fact. This is the Satan \"after us,\" that wants to undo the positive effect of the mitzvot we have performed by causing us to regret our actions. If the Yetzer Hara can make us think we've lost out in some way by doing mitzvot, then we are robbed of the reward for performing them.\r\n\r\nThus, we ask God both for the strength to resist temptation \"before us\" - so that we can carry out His will, as well as for the ability to remain committed to our decisions after the fact and not lose the reward.\r\n\r\nMay we merit to perform all the mitzvot and to be happy with them, knowing with certainty that no negativity or bitterness is caused by our fulfillment of the Divine will. May our wholehearted performance of mitzvot cause us to be blessed with reward - both in this world and the next.",

    vort: 'In this week\'s Parsha, we are introduced to our patriarch, Jacob, and his twin brother, Esau. Rashi explains {Genesis 25:27} that it was impossible to distinguish between the different natures of the twins while they were still minors, but as soon as they reached the age of 13, their true characteristics emerged: Jacob went off to learn Torah, while Esau went off to corrupt behavior.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that Esau\'s negativity emerged so suddenly - especially since the Talmud {Shabbat 105b} states explicitly that a person\'s inclination toward negativity {Yetzer Hara} does not operate in this fashion. The Yetzer Hara, rather than advocating sudden change, entices us to sin by urging, "Just do this one small thing." The next day, it tries to persuade us to perform another small misdeed - until eventually, a person can be convinced to serve idols.\r\n\r\nSo if the nature of the Yetzer Hara is to gradually wear down our defenses, how could Esau have gone off the Torah path so abruptly the moment he turned 13?\r\n\r\nBased on our Sages\' explanation of the nature of the Yetzer Hara, we must conclude that Esau\'s behavioral shift was in fact a gradual process. We can understand this by looking more carefully at the wording of Rashi\'s comment. Rashi states that when Jacob and Esau were children, it was impossible to DISTINGUISH the difference between them - not that there was no difference! Although Esau\'s external behavior may have been the same as Jacob\'s; nevertheless, something about them was not the same.\r\n\r\nWhat was this difference? We can suggest that Esau was a "big picture" person, who was more concerned with generalities than with details. Although as a child he performed the same mitzvot as Jacob, he disregarded the nuances and subtleties of the commandments. It was this inattention that ultimately led him to reject the Torah path entirely.\r\n\r\nDismissing the importance of details can lead to two primary dangers. First, our Sages advise {Avot 2:1}, "Be as careful with a \'minor\' mitzvah as you are with a \'major\' one, for you do not know the reward for the mitzvot." Who are we to say that what seems like a minor detail is in fact unimportant? Since we do not know the extent of the reward for our actions, it is foolish to disregard details as being unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if we are correct in our assessment, and what seems small to us is in fact small, the cumulative result of a person\'s inattention to detail may eventually result in his performing more serious transgressions. The care and attention we put into performing the details of God\'s commandments can serve as a buffer zone to prevent us from performing more serious misdeeds.\r\n\r\nWe see this idea in Deuteronomy 7:12, which enumerates all the blessings that will come to the Jewish people "if you listen {eikev tishm\'un}" to God. The word "eikev" literally means "heel," as Rashi explains: "If you observe the seemingly insignificant commandments that a person tramples with his heel, then all the blessing will come." If we are careful with the small mitzvot, eventually we will merit all of them. This shows how much we risk losing if we focus only on the big picture and ignore the fine points of mitzvot.\r\n\r\nEsau\'s name hints to his lack of concern with details. Rashi explains {Genesis 25:25} that the name "Esau" comes from the word "asui," meaning "completed." Esau was interested only in the finished, final product, not the details - and this approach led to his eventual rejection of the big picture.\r\n\r\nThe name Yaakov, on the other hand, contains within it the word "eikev" {heel}. Jacob is born holding on to his brother\'s heel, demonstrating his attention to the details that are so easily trampled on and overlooked. For Jacob, the nuances and details of the mitzvot are a top priority. This awareness strengthens his commitment to the framework within which the details belong.\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to serve God in totality, and not miss the trees for the forest {or vice versa}. May we recognize that big things sometimes come in small packages, and create, through our attention to details, a shield of spiritual success and blessing.',

    vort: 'Parshat Vayetzei opens with a seemingly straightforward description of Jacob\'s travels: "And Jacob left Beersheva and went toward Haran. And he encountered the place, and he spent the night there, because the sun had set" {Genesis 28:10-11}./\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi explains that this journey symbolizes Jacob\'s departure from the Land of Israel and subsequent travels into exile. Since our tradition teaches that every experience of the patriarchs has repercussions for their descendants, it seems that Jacob\'s travels must still be relevant to our lives today./\r\n\r\nLet\'s examine the opening verses of the parsha in detail:/\r\n\r\n"And Jacob left Beersheva." The Kedushat Levi says that Jacob\'s departure from Israel hints to the spiritual greatness of the Land. He derives this from the word "Beersheva," which is a combination of be\'er and sheva. Be\'er means "well" - a source of water, symbolizing abundance and blessing. Sheva means "seven," alluding to a seven-fold increase of blessing. The Land of Israel is therefore the source of spiritual abundance./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPAIN OF EXILE/\r\n\r\nThe verse continues: "...and he went toward Haran." Jacob understands that his journey out of the Land of Israel will cause his descendants to be exiled in the future. According to the Kedushat Levi, the word "Haran" is related to the phrase "charon af," meaning "anger." God\'s displeasure at the Jewish people\'s future behavior will result in their being exiled from the Land./\r\n\r\nThis knowledge causes Jacob great pain, as the next part of the verse indicates: "And he encountered the place" {vayif\'ga ba-makom}. The word vayifga shares a root with the word lifgo\'ah, which means "to injure." Furthermore, the word makom, beyond its simple meaning of "place," often refers to God Himself, the foundation of the world {Bereishit Raba 68:9}./\r\n\r\nWe can understand from these words that Jacob did not only feel the people\'s pain at being exiled, but he also felt God\'s pain at being compelled to exile His children./\r\n\r\nJacob was highly sensitive to the pain of exile. Therefore, the verse continues, "...and he spent the night there, because the sun had set." The exile is compared to night. Jacob saw that his journeys out of Israel would eventually lead to the darkness of exile descending upon the Jewish people. Just as Jacob slept, the people, too, would be compelled to "sleep."/\r\n\r\nJacob understood that his actions were only a prelude to what would happen to his descendants. Based on this idea, we can suggest a deeper understanding of the words, "And Jacob left" {vayeitzei Yaakov}. Jacob "came out of himself" by allowing himself to feel the pain of the Jewish exile. He broadened his focus, shifting his attention away from himself and making room for others. This teaches us a valuable lesson about the importance of feeling other people\'s pain./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSECRET SIGNS/\r\n\r\nWe see another demonstration of this quality in Genesis 15:13, when God tells Abraham that the Jewish people will be enslaved to a foreign nation for 400 years. We know from other sources, however, that the Jewish people served in Egypt for only 210 years {Rashi on Genesis 42:2}. How can we reconcile this contradiction?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kedushat Levi, as soon as Abraham was informed about the future Egyptian exile, he felt the pain that the Jewish people would experience there. His pain was so acute that God subtracted 190 years from the original decree!/\r\n\r\nThis ability to feel the pain of others also helps us to see why Rachel was the ideal wife for Jacob. Jacob had arranged to marry Rachel, yet he suspected that his future father-in-law Laban would try to deceive him in some way. He and Rachel therefore agreed upon secret signs that would enable them to recognize each others\' true identity. When Rachel learned of Laban\'s plan to give her sister Leah to Jacob instead, she taught Leah these secret signs - because she was so sensitive to the pain that Leah would experience were she to be publicly humiliated under the chuppah {Talmud - Megilla 13}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nRETURN TO THE LAND/\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jacob feels the pain of the Jewish people\'s exile and goes to sleep in the darkness, God blesses him with the promise, "Behold, I am with you, and I will guard you wherever you go, and I will return you to this Land" {Genesis 28:13-15}. We can learn from this blessing the tremendous power of developing sensitivity to others. Although God\'s Presence is with us even in the exile, feeling other people\'s pain can give us the merit to return to the Land of Israel. The blessing that Jacob receives is a message to us as well./\r\n\r\nMay we all learn to become sensitive and responsive to the pain of others, and may this ability bring us one step closer to the final redemption, when we will be gathered from exile and return to our land in peace.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'In this week\'s parsha, Jacob journeys homeward after a 22-year absence, and meets his brother, Esau, on the way. Jacob prepares himself for the potentially dangerous encounter in three ways: he prays to God; he divides his family into two camps {a protective measure in case of battle}; and he sends gifts ahead to his brother./\r\n\r\nOur mystical tradition teaches that Esau is the personification of the yetzer hara {inclination toward negativity} in this world. Therefore, on a deeper level, Jacob is not only preparing himself to meet Esau, but is readying himself to battle the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nJacob pleads to God, "Please save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau" {Genesis 32:12}. Why does Jacob use this repetitive language? He has only one brother, and there is only one Esau. Either description would have been sufficient on its own!/\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi and the Ben Ish Chai both understand this seeming redundancy as a hint to two different approaches of the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nOne approach of the yetzer hara is to attack us outright, and to try to actively prevent us from following God\'s will. This approach is called "Esau" - the overt use of force to keep us from practicing Judaism./\r\n\r\nBut the yetzer hara can also make inroads by causing us to let down our guard. This more subtle approach is what Jacob calls "my brother." At times, nations will not attack us overtly, but will instead try to befriend us. Historically, this approach has the same effect as the use of force. When we become relaxed and comfortable within a non-Jewish environment, the clarity of what God wants from us begins to fade, and we are susceptible to giving up our beliefs./\r\n\r\nThrough this idea, we can see that the verse is not redundant at all. When Jacob asks to be saved "from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau," he is asking for two different types of protection. He requests the strength to resist the temptations of false brotherhood and camaraderie {"my brother"} as well as the ability to protect himself from overt physical attack {"Esau"}./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with clarity and awareness, so that we will not be taken advantage of or swayed - either by force or by false friendship - to compromise our Judaism.',

    vort: 'Among the many events in this week\'s parsha is the story of Yehuda\'s daughter-in-law, Tamar, giving birth to twins. The Torah goes into substantial detail about this event {Genesis 38:27-30}:/\r\n\r\nAs Tamar is giving birth, the hand of one twin emerges, and the midwife ties a string around it so she will know which child was born first. This baby then draws back his hand and his brother, Peretz, is born. Only then does Tamar give birth to the baby with the string on his hand, who is named Zerach./\r\n\r\nAll the details about this birth seem unnecessary, especially given that the Torah recounts almost nothing further about Peretz and Zerach. The Torah does not describe the births of Abraham or many other great personalities. What is the relevance of the play-by-play description of the birth of these twins?/\r\n\r\nThe Kedushat Levi provides a metaphorical understanding of this passage that will help us gain deeper insight. The Talmud {Niddah 30b} teaches that every unborn baby has a candle lit at its head, and the baby\'s soul can see from one end of the world to the other. When the baby emerges from its mother\'s womb, an angel taps it on the lips, and the baby forgets all the Torah it learned in the womb./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kedushat Levi, this tap on the lips should be understood not as a punishment, but rather as a Divine gift. This world is filled with temptation, and knowledge is sometimes misused to pursue corrupt goals. At the moment of birth, God takes away all our knowledge so that we will enter this world in a state of purity. The innocence of infancy enables us to begin life with a pure, complete connection to God./\r\n\r\nAs we grow and mature, God creates a barrier {mechitza}, making it more difficult for us to achieve the complete Divine connection that was so natural for us as children. Nevertheless, we can use our mature intelligence to reconnect to God - if we realize that this world is purposeless for its own sake. Our Sages state this idea succinctly: "The more flesh, the more worms" {Avot 2:7}. Pure physicality, devoid of purpose, lacks meaning./\r\n\r\nThis is hinted to in the names Peretz and Zerach: We can choose to use our intelligence to recognize this, and to connect to God by breaking through {paratz} the barrier that our knowledge creates. Once this barrier is broken, God will shine {zarach} a holy light upon us./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nSHINING LIGHT/\r\n\r\nOn a deeper level, this is the lesson that the Torah is conveying to us through the story of the birth of Tamar\'s twins. The paradigm of birth applies to all of us, hinting to our desire to recreate ourselves and grow in positive directions. At the beginning of the passage describing the birth, the Torah tells us, "and he put out his hand" {Genesis 38:28}. This can be understood as God extending His hand - a metaphorical interpretation of the Divine assistance we receive at birth when our knowledge is removed, enabling us to begin life in a state of purity without succumbing to temptation./\r\n\r\nThe next verse, "and he withdrew his hand" {Genesis 38:29}, can be understood as God removing His assistance as we mature, since the barrier of knowledge makes it more difficult to connect to the Divine./\r\n\r\nWhen the Torah states, "And behold! his brother emerged," we have a hint to the birth of a child, coming into the world with the potential to come close to the Divine and to reach a state of "brotherhood," as it were, with God./\r\n\r\nAs we grow up and our knowledge matures, we can make the choice to break {paratz} the intellectual barriers that separates us from God. This makes us worthy of the name Peretz {literally, "breaking"}. When we make this choice, God shines {zorey\'ach} a holy light upon us, as is indicated by the name Zerach {literally, "shining"}./\r\n\r\nThe story of this birth appears in so much detail because it does not refer only to Peretz and Zerach; rather, it hints to the possibilities inherent in every birth. The Torah teaches us that we all have the potential to reconnect to God as we grow and mature./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to use our intellectual capacities to break down all barriers and regain our innate innocence and purity so that God will shine upon us the holy light.',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha always falls out at the Chanukah season. The Talmud {Shabbat 22a} teaches that the Chanukah Menorah should ideally be lit on the left side of the doorway to one\'s home, resulting in the home\'s entrance being surrounded by objects of mitzvah: the Menorah on the left side, and the Mezuzah on the right. The Midrash adds further that a person wearing a Tallit is in the center./\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, we know that the mitzvah of lighting the Menorah involves all three of these elements. The Talmud {Shabbat 21b} introduces Chanukah with the statement "ner ish u\'beito" {"a light, a person, and his home"}. But what is the deeper message of this imagery? What lesson are our Sages trying to convey?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Shabbat 21b} teaches that the mitzvah of kindling Chanukah lights can be performed on three different levels: basic {"mitzvah"}, extra good {"mehadrin"}, and super-deluxe {"mehadrin min ha-mehadrin"}./\r\n\r\nHillel and Shammai disagree regarding the fulfillment of this last, most ideal level. Hillel claims that we should kindle one light on the first night of Chanukah and add one light on each successive night, resulting in eight lights by the end of the festival. His opinion is based on the principle that kedusha {holiness} is only increased, never decreased./\r\n\r\nShammai\'s opinion is the exact opposite. He claims that we should begin Chanukah by kindling eight lights, and then subtract them one by one as the festival progresses. Shammai compares Chanukah to Sukkot, when the number of offerings in the Holy Temple decreased over the course of the holiday./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nPLACE, TIME & SELF/\r\n\r\nShammai\'s connection between Chanukah and Sukkot will help us understand the symbolism of the Menorah on the left, the Mezuzah on the right, and the person wearing a Tallit in the middle./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Sfat Emet, this world is composed of three dimensions to be sanctified and elevated: the dimension of PLACE, the dimension of TIME, and the dimension of SELF. All three of these elements are mentioned in the Talmud and Midrash, hinting that Chanukah affords us with the opportunity to sanctify all three dimensions at once:/\r\n\r\nThe Mezuzah is affixed on the doorpost of a house, representing the sanctification of PLACE. The Menorah, which is used to count the days as Chanukah progresses, represents the sanctification of TIME. The person wearing a Tallit represents the sanctification of SELF./\r\n\r\nBased on Shammai\'s approach, Chanukah can be understood as a culmination of Sukkot, since Sukkot also symbolizes the unity of the three dimensions. The Sukkah represents the dimension of Place; the seven-day duration of the holiday represents the dimension of Time; and the four species symbolize different parts of the human body, corresponding to the dimension of Self. These three dimensions are expressed on Sukkot, and they culminate on Chanukah, when the spiritual potential for unity is once again brought into physical reality./\r\n\r\nMay we all learn to carry the message of Sukkot into our daily lives and to see it manifest in Chanukah. May we succeed in elevating all three dimensions - our homes, ourselves, and every moment of our lives - and may that sanctity and unity create a strong, radiant light to shine through all generations.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'Joseph\'s behavior teaches us how far we must go not to embarrass others./\r\n\r\nGreetings from the holy city of Jerusalem!/\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers. After Yehuda\'s impassioned plea for Binyamin\'s release, the Torah tells us {Genesis 45:1} that Joseph could not restrain himself any longer. Rashi explains that Joseph could not bear the thought of embarrassing his brothers in front of the Egyptians in the room. The revelation of his true identity would mean revealing that his brothers had sold him, and that this would be intensely humiliating for them. Therefore, Joseph ordered all his Egyptian servants to leave the room, before he stated, "I am Joseph."/\r\n\r\nWe might wonder how Rashi knows that Joseph was primarily concerned with preventing his brothers\' embarrassment. Perhaps he sent out his servants because it would not be proper for a great leader to cry in front of his subordinates. In other words, maybe Joseph was interested only in preventing his OWN embarrassment!/\r\n\r\nThe Iturei Torah counters this claim by pointing out that Joseph, immediately after sending out his servants, raised his voice and cried so loudly that all of Egypt and everyone in Pharaoh\'s palace heard his sobbing {Genesis 45:2}. Clearly, Joseph was not concerned with maintaining his own dignity if this is how he behaved. Therefore, he must have dismissed the Egyptians only in order to prevent his brothers\' public humiliation./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nSTILL CONNECTED/\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s behavior teaches us how far we must go to keep from embarrassing others. Shortly after Joseph breaks down in tears, he tells his brothers, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold down to Egypt" {Genesis 45:4}. The Ohr HaChaim comments that the word "your brother," which seems superfluous in this context, actually conveys an important message. Through the intentional addition of this word, Joseph is telling his family, "Even when you sold me down to Egypt, I was still your brother. Even in the midst of that incredibly challenging time, I still loved you and still felt connected to you."/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Sfat Emet points out that the word asher {"whom"} in this verse can have the connotation of yasher kochacha, an expression that means "congratulations" or "thank you" {literally, "Your strength should be upright"}. We see an example of this definition in Exodus 34:1, when God tells Moses to carve a second set of Tablets like the first ones "that you broke" {asher shibarta}. The Talmud {Shabbat 87a} explains that the word asher here means yasher kochacha - in other words, that Moses deserved congratulations for breaking the first set of Tablets./\r\n\r\nBased on this interpretation, we can understand the word asher in our verse the same way. Joseph tells his brothers, "I am Joseph your brother, whom {asher} you sold down to Egypt." According to the Sfat Emet, Joseph is implying, "I congratulate you for selling me down to Egypt, because it enabled me to support our entire family."/\r\n\r\nInstead of being bitter or angry about his treatment, Joseph sees how the brothers\' actions actually led to great benefit. They should not be condemned for selling him; rather, they should be congratulated!/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nLOVE AND WARMTH/\r\n\r\nImagine how we would feel if we were in Joseph\'s place - how difficult it would be for us to rise above our own hurt and resentment. Yet Joseph goes to great lengths to treat his brothers respectfully. Not only is he concerned with their possible humiliation, sending out his entourage so that no disparaging information will be overheard, but he even thanks his brothers for selling him!/\r\n\r\nWe can learn from here how to approach situations where we feel slighted. Joseph does not allow himself to be dominated by feelings of bitterness about the past. Rather, he emphasizes the positive aspects of the situation, to where he is able to relate to his brothers with true warmth and respect./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to cultivate a warm, loving attitude toward every other person. May we learn to overcome resentments about the way we were treated in the past, rising above our own hurt so we can see the ultimate good in every situation./\r\nJust as Joseph was reunited with his family, which brought about redemption for all of the Jewish people at that time, so may we deserve to see unity and camaraderie among all the Jewish people and our final redemption.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'In this week\'s portion, Jacob is on his deathbed and tells his children: "Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen at the End of Days" {Genesis 49:1}. However, this information is never disclosed! Instead, Jacob blesses each one of his sons, and no further mention is made of the prophetic vision he promised to reveal./\r\n\r\nAccording to Rashi, the Divine Presence left Jacob as he was about to tell his sons what would happen at the End of Days. Since Jacob was unable to prophesy without Divine assistance, he blessed his children instead. But why would the Divine Presence depart from Jacob precisely at this time?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Naftali of Rupshitz suggests that once Jacob looked into the future, he saw all the pain that the Jewish people would have to endure until the end of time, and this saddened him so much that the Divine Presence left him. The Talmud teaches {Shabbat 30b} that sadness prevents a person from being able to receive prophesy. Therefore, once Jacob was overwhelmed with sorrow for the Jewish people, he no longer had clarity about future events./\r\n\r\nThis teaches us a powerful lesson about what it means to feel the pain of others./\r\nA story told about Rav Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev is instructive. Rav Levi Yitzhak once visited an ill person who was very worried about whether he would receive a place in the World to Come. Upon hearing the man\'s concern, Rav Levi Yitzhak called over some of his students to act as witnesses, whereupon he drew up a document transferring his own portion in the Next World to the ill man. His students signed the document, and a few moments later the man died./\r\n\r\nThe students were shocked by their rabbi\'s behavior, and they asked him why he had acted in such a manner. Rav Levi Yitzhak replied, "To make a Jew who is suffering feel calm and at ease, even for one moment, is worth more than the entire World to Come."/\r\n\r\n{It seems possible that the reward Rav Levi Yitzhak received for this great act of compassion far outweighed the reward that he signed over to the dying man!}/\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nALL THREE WORLDS/\r\n\r\nThese examples show that holy people do not live for themselves; they live for others. We see this in the Torah when it states, "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt" {Genesis 47:28}. The Meshech Chochma explains that Jacob did not merely live in the land of Egypt for his own sake; his "life" was for everyone! His care for others, including the Egyptians, affected the entire world - since, at the time, the whole world depended on Egypt for their food supply. Thus, Jacob\'s complete lack of self-centeredness had a positive impact on the entire world./\r\n\r\nWe see this as well in the verse where Jacob tells Joseph, "I am giving you one shchem MORE THAN YOUR BROTHERS" {Genesis 48:22}. What is the meaning of the word shchem? On a literal level, it means "portion." Rashi understands it to refer to the city of Shchem, which Jacob describes as conquering with his sword and his bow./\r\n\r\nOnkelos, in his Aramaic translation, defines "my sword and my bow" as "my prayer and my requests."/\r\n\r\nAccording to Rebbe Nachman of Breslov {Likutei Maharan}, these prayers had an effect on all three worlds: the lower world {shafel} in which we live; the middle world {kochavim} of outer space and galaxies; and the highest world {malachim}, which is the realm of the angels. The acronym of these three Hebrew words {SH-afel, K-ochavim, M-alachim} spells SHCHEM!/\r\n\r\nThus we see again that Jacob did not live only for himself or his family. He did not pray only on his own behalf, or on behalf of the people and cities in his immediate surroundings. Jacob prayed for the acronym of Shchem - for everyone in all three worlds./\r\n\r\nAs we conclude the Book of Genesis, we should reflect on the lessons it teaches us. Over and over we see an emphasis on empathy for others - shifting the focus away from our individual, self-centered concerns in order to be as sensitive as possible to the needs of others. Our patriarchs and matriarchs exemplify this quality. It is a necessary foundation - a prerequisite that must be integrated into the Jewish national character before we can appreciate the redemption of the Book of Exodus./\r\n\r\nMay we integrate this lesson into our own lives and be blessed to develop unity, camaraderie, and compassion for each other, so that we merit the ultimate redemption, soon in our days.',

    vort: '\r\nThis week, we begin the Book of Exodus. One of the primary events of this week\'s portion is the story of the Burning Bush {Exodus 3:2}. It seems odd that God would choose to appear to Moses in this way. Why was a bush necessary at all? Couldn\'t God have appointed Moses as the redeemer of the Jewish people without a Burning Bush, in the same way that He appeared to the other prophets?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe helps us resolve this question by distinguishing between the two parts of the Burning Bush: {1} the fire on the outside, and {2} the bush on the inside. According to his interpretation, the fire represents all the impurities of the world - in particular, the impurities of Egypt. Fire symbolizes burning passions that can cause one to yield to temptation, and that have the ability to consume any obstacle that stands in their way. The bush, on the other hand, symbolizes the spiritual strength that each of us carries deep within. This inner strength is an eternal core that can never be consumed./\r\n\r\nMoses saw how steeped the Jewish people were in the impurities of Egyptian society. He thought that the people would never be able to rise above their degraded spiritual state because he assumed they were satisfied with their current level. This could have been a tragic misconception. According to the Admor of Kuvrin, the worst thing we can do is to sell ourselves short. Once we convince ourselves that we will never be able to grow beyond our current level, we actually prevent ourselves from achieving our ultimate potential!/\r\n\r\nThis is why God tells Moses, "I have seen {ra\'oh ra\'iti} the affliction of My people in Egypt" {Exodus 3:7}. The Midrash {Shmot Raba 3:2} points out that the verb "to see" appears in two forms in this verse. This double language hints to God\'s penetrating vision - as if God were saying to Moses, "You see with only one pair of eyes, but I see with an additional pair." Before the revelation at the Burning Bush, Moses lacked faith in the Jewish people’s ability to overcome the challenges in their path and grow to greater levels. Moses saw only the fires of impurity on the outside./\r\n\r\nGod, however, saw the people\'s inner spiritual power - a strength that, like the bush, would never be destroyed. Moses needed to experience the Burning Bush in order to develop confidence in the people\'s ability to shed their surface impurity and tap into their powerful spiritual core./\r\n\r\nMay we always be satisfied with our material state of being {as it says in Avot 4:1, "Who is wealthy? One who is happy with his portion"}, but never be satisfied with our spiritual achievements. We should take pleasure in what we have accomplished thus far, but not see our current achievements as indicators of our ultimate potential. And may we have the courage to tap into our deepest inner essence and constantly grow, no matter what fires we may have played with on the outside./',

    vort: "In this week's parsha, God speaks to Moses and tells him to say to the Jewish people:/\r\n\r\n\"I am God, and I will take you out from under the burdens of Egypt; and I will save you from their service; and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great judgments. And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be a God to you...\" {Exodus 6:6-7}/\r\n\r\nThis passage uses four separate expressions of redemption. Surely any one of these expressions alone would have sufficed to convey God's promise to redeem the Jewish people! Why are all four necessary?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Netivot Shalom explains that these four promises are not merely expressions of redemption; rather, they represent four separate redemptions {see also Talmud Yerushalmi, Pesachim 10:1}. These four redemptions can be understood as four stages of redemption that were needed to completely liberate the Jews from Egyptian exile./\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people in Egypt had fallen to the lowest possible spiritual level. The Midrash {Socher Tov on Psalms 114} compares the enslaved Jewish nation to a fetus within the womb of an impure animal, based on the verse, \"...to take for Himself a nation from amidst a nation\" {Deut. 4:34}. The Jewish people were living \"inside\" the Egyptians. Their identity was completely meshed with the corruption and immorality of Egyptian society./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, since the situation was so severe, the first stage of redemption was for the Jews to be taken out from the darkness and impurity of their surrounding culture. Nevertheless, they were still slaves to their inner drive toward negativity {yetzer hara}. The second stage, then, was to be saved from this servitude. The slave mentality cannot be so easily eradicated, however; even after being saved, the Jewish people were still subjugated to the side of negativity. It was this subjugation from which God redeemed the Jews. The final stage of redemption was for God to take the Jews as His nation.\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPROGRESSIVE IDENTITY/\r\n\r\nWhen we look carefully at the progression of these four stages, we see the Jewish people slowly moving away from their Egyptian neighbors and defining their own identity, gradually transforming from Egypt's possession to God's. This process enabled the Jews to grow into themselves and recognize their unique identity as a people./\r\n\r\nThe ten plagues {seven of which are found in this week's parsha} are a concrete example of this process. As the plagues progress, the Jews' separation from the Egyptians becomes increasingly clear. This distancing from other nations is not a blanket condemnation; rather, it entails a rejection of those secular influences that are destructive to spiritual growth or antithetical to Torah values. This process of separation helps crystallize the Jewish people's unique identity./\r\n\r\nThe Ibn Ezra {on Exodus 8:28, citing Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi} notes that the plagues progressed from the bottom up. The first two plagues, blood and frogs, involved water, which flows to the lowest places on earth. The next two plagues, lice and wild beasts, took place on the land - one step higher than water. The following plagues, livestock epidemic and boils, were caused by airborne disease - one step higher than land. The plagues of hail and locusts involved clouds {the locusts formed a cloud of their own!}, representing the highest reaches of the atmosphere. The plague of darkness took place on a level even beyond that, in the celestial realm. And the death of the firstborn affected people's very souls, coming from beyond the furthest galaxies./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Shmot Raba 9:10} explains that during every plague, the Egyptians were stricken, while the Jews were spared. However, the Jews who completely identified themselves with the Egyptians were not saved {Shmot Raba 14:3}. They died during the plague of darkness. Their desire to become like the Egyptians ultimately resulted in their sharing the same fate as their neighbors./\r\n\r\nWe can learn from the process of the Jews' redemption from Egypt how valuable it is for us to maintain a unique identity and not to align ourselves with value systems that are antithetical to Torah. Even the non-Jewish prophet Bilaam recognized this when he described the Jewish people as \"a nation that dwells alone, and is not reckoned among the nations\" {Numbers 23:9}. This quality of separateness, which is so often misunderstood, is actually the source of our strength as a nation. While other nations rise and fall, we are still here to tell the tale. The degree to which we preserve Jewish identity is the degree to which that identity will preserve us./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to succeed in separating ourselves from any philosophy that is counterproductive to spiritual growth, and through building ourselves gradually, may we merit to soon be redeemed from this dark exile.",

He is asking, "What is this service lachem {for you}?" In other words, the wicked son thinks that the whole reason we eat the Passover offering is for our own sake. We are doing it because it tastes good, because we enjoy it!/\r\n\r\nWe find a proof for this when God tells Abraham: "Lech lecha m\'artezcha" {Genesis 12:1}, which means "go for yourself from your land." Based on the Midrash, Rashi explains: "Go for your own pleasure." God is promising Abraham wealth, fame, and power. The word "lecha" means "for your benefit and pleasure."/\r\n\r\nSo too, in our case, the word "lachem" {the plural of lecha} means the same thing. The wicked son it asking: "what is this service lachem?" It is for your own enjoyment. He says: "Stop kidding yourselves into thinking that you are doing the will of God. You are really just hiding behind your religiosity as you go about fulfilling your own desires." The wicked son simply cannot understand how it is possible to do things that are pleasurable completely for the sake of Heaven./\r\n\r\nSure, we want to serve God better and improve ourselves. Yet, how can we know if what we are doing is really for God, or because of some ulterior motive? Maybe we do it all for our own sakes. Even when it comes to Torah and mitzvot, maybe we are thinking, "What\'s in it for me?"/\r\n\r\nThis is a serious question which we have to ask ourselves. This is what bothers the wicked son./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLITMUS TEST/\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov offers three pieces of advice to help clarify whether we are really serving God or ourselves:/\r\n\r\nRemove all pleasure./\r\nMeditation./\r\nThe light of God./\r\nTo explain: The Ba\'al Shem Tov first recommends that we imagine that all pleasure has been removed from a mitzvah. In reality, it is a good thing to derive pleasure from mitzvot, but for the purposes of this exercise we should imagine that we have no taste buds and we\'re not getting anything out of eating matzah. Would we still spend the time, effort and money to do this mitzvah? We have to honestly ask ourselves this question. If the answer is "yes," this is an indication that we are indeed doing it completely for God./\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov gives the second piece of advice: We need to ask ourselves whether what we are about to do is really a mitzvah. One should meditate and consider that maybe the opposite of what you are about to do is the really the will of God. It requires patience before we jump to do a mitzvah. Are we really doing it for the sake of God, or for ourselves?/\r\n\r\nThe Ba\'al Shem Tov gives us the third piece of advice on how to check our motives. He calls it "the light of God." Sometimes after we have removed all pleasure, and we have done some deep meditation, we still find ourselves in the dark and can\'t decide what to do. At that time we need God to reveal Himself, and light the path for us. God hid His light in the Torah, and that is where we can access it. We have to turn to the Torah, or to those who know the Torah, for guidance./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLESSONS FROM THE PLAGUES/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the Ba\'al Shem Tov\'s three pieces of advice correspond to the three plagues mentioned in this week\'s parsha. The numerical value of the name "Bo" is also three. Three plagues are placed in this week\'s parsha, separate from the other seven, because they correspond to the three pieces of advice, as follows:/\r\n\r\nFirst came the plague of locusts, which removed all pleasure. They ate up all the food in the land. Then came the plague of darkness, which was the perfect opportunity for meditation, for asking oneself, "Am I living by what I want to do, or by what God wants me to do?"/\r\n\r\nThen came the final plague, the Death of the Firstborn. This came in the middle of the night, and in that darkness God revealed himself. He passed over the homes where Jews were eating the Passover lamb, for the sake of Heaven. Those who perished were those who fooled themselves into thinking that they were really doing the will of God, but in reality they were basically serving themselves. The light of God made the truth clear./\r\n\r\nMay we all have the clarity to know the true path, so that we are not fooled by the yetzer hara, who sometimes tries to paint negativity as something spiritual. And may we merit to see the light in the darkness, all the days of our lives.',

    vort: 'This week\'s Torah reading tells of the Exodus from Egypt. In his monumental work, Netivot Shalom, the Slonimer Rebbe writes that the Jewish people merited to leave Egypt only because they cultivated within themselves a concept of kedusha {holiness}./\r\n\r\nThis is based on the verse: "And Moses took the bones of Yosef" {Exodus 13:19}. However the word for "bones" - "atzamot" - is very close to another Hebrew word, "atzmuto," which means "his essence." Moses, the leader of the Jewish people, did not only take the bones of Yosef; he also took with him the essence of Yosef./\r\n\r\nWhat is the essence of Yosef? Yosef is identified with yesod {foundation}, which is one of the Ten Sefirot {channels} through which God causes His influence to permeate this world. Each of the sefirot correlates with a part of the body, for example the head, the heart, etc. The sefira of yesod is identified with the reproductive organs./\r\n\r\nThis is the essence of Yosef HaTzaddik, Yosef the righteous one, who withheld himself from engaging in immorality with the wife of Potiphar and anyone else./\r\n\r\nSo Moses took with him not just the bones of Yosef, but also the essence of what Yosef represents - which is kedusha, separateness from immorality. Only in the merit of kedusha are the Jewish people redeemed from Egypt./\r\nThe commandment to be holy is repeated more often throughout the Torah than any other mitzvah. For example, we find in next week\'s parsha {Yitro}: "And you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" {Exodus 19:6}. And in the portion after that {Mishpatim}: "You shall be holy people unto me"{Exodus 22:30}. And we find in parshat Kedoshim: "You shall be holy" {Leviticus 19:2}. Later it says: "Sanctify yourselves and be holy for I am the Lord your God. And you shall keep my laws and do them. I am the Lord who sanctifies you" {Leviticus 20:7-8}./\r\n\r\nThe Zohar {3:190b} points out that the word kedusha is mentioned three times in this latter excerpt. The Slonimer Rebbe says that this teaches us that we have to sanctify all three parts of the human being – mind, heart and limbs. Through this will come a rectification of the ten sefirot, which are grouped into three categories. The first group - chochmah {wisdom}, bina {understanding} and da\'at {knowledge} - corresponds to the mind. The next three - chesed {kindness}, gevura {strength} and tiferet {beauty} - correlate with the heart. The final four - netzach {eternity}, hod {glory}, yesod {foundation} and malchut {sovereignty} - correlate with the limbs./\r\n\r\nThis sheds light on the verse in Isaiah 6:3: "Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh" - "Holy, holy, holy." We have to sanctify all three parts of the human being: mind, heart and limbs./\r\n\r\nThe verse continues "The Lord of Hosts, the whole world is filled with His glory." What is the significance of the word "melo" {filled}? It means that we have to fulfill the acronym of the word melo. The mem is for the moach {mind}, the lamed is for lev {heart} and the aleph is for eivarim {limbs}. That is why holiness is mentioned three times in parshat Kedoshim and Isaiah./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nFULL SANCTITY/\r\n\r\nAnother significance of the triple repetition is that they represent the three dimensions in which human beings operate: place, time and self. We have to sanctify every place - our homes, our workplaces, etc. We have to sanctify every moment so that it will productive and constructive. And finally, we ourselves need to be holy./\r\n\r\nObviously, being holy is a very central part of being Jewish. So, the Slonimer Rebbe asks, why isn\'t it counted as one of the 613 commandants of the Torah? He answers that holiness is not a specific or technical issue that can be addressed by Jewish Law. Rather, it is what being Jewish is all about. If a person is not holy, he is not just lacking in one particular area, his Judaism is deficient as a whole. Holiness is the true measure of a Jew and any lack in this area is a blemish on one\'s entire being./\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe maintains that just as there is no commandment to "be Jewish," so too "being holy" is so much of the essence, that it cannot be an individual commandment./\r\n\r\nAs the Torah says: "You are a holy nation unto God your God and God has chosen you" {Deut. 14:2}. It is only when we choose to live the lives of a holy people that we merit being the chosen people. Instead of being numbered among the 613 specific commandments, holiness is a "global mitzvah."/\r\n\r\nAccording to the teachings of the Ba\'al Shem Tov on this week\'s parsha, one of the ways we can achieve holiness is by keeping our minds occupied with holy things. Our hearts and limbs generally follow our minds, so we are basically defined by what we think about. When our minds are preoccupied with holy thoughts, then we become holy people. However, if our minds are occupied with unholy thoughts, then our minds and bodies will inevitably follow./\r\n\r\nMay we all think holy, and be holy, and live up to the innate holiness that lies inside us. Just as our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt in the merit of their holiness, so we too should be redeemed from our current exile in the merit of our own efforts to be holy.',

    vort: 'This week\'s Torah Portion, Yitro, begins with the verse:/\r\n\r\n"Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law, heard all that God did for Moses and for Israel his people." {Exodus 18:1}./\r\n\r\nAlthough it says that Yitro heard all that God had done, nonetheless the Talmud {Zevachim 116a} says that there were three specific things that Yitro heard which inspired him to come running across the desert to join the Jewish people./\r\n\r\n1.Splitting of the Red Sea./\r\n2.War against Amalek./\r\n3.Giving of the Torah./\r\nWe need to understand why it was specifically these three events which inspired him to come to the camp of Israel./\r\n\r\nFurthermore we must examine this verse, which describes Yitro as "the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law." The first description is a disgrace, referring to his idolatrous past. The second description is one of praise, noting that he is Moses\'s father-in-law. Why do we label Yitro with these two diametrically opposed titles?/\r\n\r\nLet us share an idea based on the "Tiferet Shmuel" {volume 2}. Even if a person achieves the highest of spiritual levels, it is possible for that person to fall to the lowest of places. This is more likely when a person quickly "jumps levels" and takes on too much at one time. When one takes on more than he can handle in terms of spiritual growth, this can backfire. The person can become frustrated and tense to the point where he cracks and falls back down again./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happened to the Jewish people after they crossed the Red Sea. The "Yalkut Reuveni" says that before the Splitting of the Sea, the angels testified to God that the Egyptians are idolaters and the Jews are idolaters as well {Exodus 14:28}. "Why should the Jews be saved and the Egyptians destroyed?" they asked. "Let\'s destroy them both."/\r\n\r\nWe find that before the Splitting of the Red Sea the Jews were just as involved in idolatry as the Egyptians. They had reached the lowest of the lowest levels. However, immediately after the splitting of the Red Sea, they proclaimed: "This is my God and I will glorify him" {Exodus 15:2}. The Midrash {Mechilta} says that even the simplest of Jews saw a vision of God which was even greater than that which the prophet Ezekiel saw. It did not take very long to cross the sea, and in that short span of time the Jewish people went from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high. They jumped from the spiritual depths all the way to the top./\r\n\r\nTherefore we find toward the end of last week\'s portion that during the war against Amalek, the Jewish people ask, "Is God with us or not?" {Exodus 17:7} How could this be? A moment ago they all pointed and said "this is my God." How can these very same people doubt that God is among them and performing all these miracles? How can the Jews, who were such great prophets, also be borderline heretics?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps this happened because they jumped from the lowest to the highest in such a short span of time - something which is not healthy in spiritual growth and can cause a person to fall all the way back down./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nLEVELS OF HEARING/\r\n\r\nThere are different levels of hearing. The commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains the greatness in the Jewish people\'s statement, "We will do and we will hear," by noting that the word "we will do" {na\'aseh} comes first {see also Shabbat 88a}. By saying "we will do," the Jewish people expressed their ability to do the will of God even before they were specifically commanded in the mitzvot. They could intuitively "hear" God\'s desires. According to the Ohr Gedaliyahu, this very high level of hearing demonstrated the Jewish people\'s great love for God, in which they were able to anticipate His wishes./\r\n\r\nIn the second, slightly lower level of hearing, we are unable to perceive God\'s desires before He expresses them. Nevertheless, once He articulates His will, we are able to discern the deeper message of the mitzvot. In other words, through each mitzvah itself, we can understand what God wants from us./\r\n\r\nThrough this idea, we can understand why the Jewish people use two different expressions - "we will do" {na\'aseh} and "we will do and we will hear" {na\'aseh v\'nishma}. The first expression {na\'aseh} corresponds to the highest level of hearing. Without hearing explicit instructions, how did the Jews know what to do? It must be that they were able to intuit God’s will even without physically hearing them articulated./\r\n\r\nThe second expression {na\'aseh v\'nishma} corresponds to the second level of hearing, in which we are able to hear, through the mitzvot, what God really wants from us. After acting on what we have been told, we can hear God\'s will./\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe adds that this second level of hearing applies not only to mitzvot, but also to every situation we encounter in life. Each circumstance in which we find ourselves contains custom-tailored lessons for us to learn, if only we are able to hear them. For example, if a mentally unstable person on the street starts yelling at us for no apparent reason, instead of getting angry at him, we can assume that, for some reason, we are intended to hear his words. Perhaps there is some kernel of truth in what he is saying that can teach us a lesson./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nCLIMBING THE LADDER/\r\n\r\nThe giving of the Ten Commandments in this week\'s parsha teaches us that growth has to be slow and deliberate. God did not give us one huge commandment, but rather gave us ten individual commandments. This teaches us that growth comes one step at a time. As the Talmud says {Makkot 23b}, "Rebbi Chananyah ben Akashia says that God wanted to give the Jewish people merit and therefore he increased the Torah and its Commandments."/\r\n\r\nTorah has to be absorbed one step and one mitzvah at a time. The Ten Commandments reflects this by stating each mitzvah one after the other. This is the meaning of Rebbi Chananyah ben Akashia\'s statement. God increased Torah and mitzvot because each is a rung on our spiritual ladder, and the more rungs we have, the safer and easier it is to ascend./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nPERMANENT JOURNEY/\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand the significance of the three things that inspired Yitro to come running across the desert. First came the splitting of the sea, where Yitro saw people at the very bottom jumping all the way to the top. Then he heard of the war against Amalek, where the Jewish people questioned God\'s existence. They plunged right back down to being heretics. This was because their process of teshuva moved too fast. Yitro knew that he was also a repentant and he worried that perhaps he too had moved too fast./\r\n\r\nIt therefore says that he heard of the giving of the Torah, which was a gradual process. First God gave the Ten Commandments and then he gave the rest of the laws. He gave the Torah one step at a time, one mitzvah a time. When he saw this, Yitro said "I need to learn how to grow at a slow and steady pace, as opposed to taking everything on all at once and causing myself to rebel."/\r\n\r\nThat is why these three events are singled out. This also helps us understand the answer to the second question of why the Torah refers to Yitro in the opening verse as "the priest of Midian, Moses\'s father-in-law." This shows that even though he became the father-in-law of the great Moses, Yitro recognized that deep down inside him remained a piece of idolatrous Midian. He already tasted that, and needed to make sure that his journey from being a priest of Midian to Moses\'s father-in-law was going to be a permanent and meaningful one./\r\n\r\nGod wants us to grow at a pace which is healthy for us and not to take on too much at once and wind up turning our backs on the entire Torah. That is certainly not the will of God. Rather, do it with caution, one step at a time, at a rate which is healthy and productive. That way we can become all we can possibly be.',

    vort: 'The Jewish people’s greatness in saying “we will do and we will understand” when accepting the Torah./\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, the Jewish people make the penultimate statement of their 40-year sojourn in the wilderness: Na\'aseh v\'nishma - "Whatever God has spoken, we will do and we will hear" {Exodus 24:7}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, the Jewish people received three rewards for preceding the word "na\'aseh" {we will do} to the word "nishma" {we will hear}. First of all, 600,000 angels crowned every Jew with two crowns: one for "na\'aseh" and one for "nishma" {Shabbat 88a}./\r\n\r\nSecondly, in response to the statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma," God called the Jewish people "My firstborn child" {Shabbat 89b on Exodus 4:22}. Finally, the Jewish people\'s utterance of "na\'aseh v\'nishma" caused a Heavenly voice to proclaim, "Who revealed this secret of the angels to My children?" {Shabbat 88a}. We see that "preceding action to listening" is an attribute of angels, as the verse says {Psalms 103:20}, "Angels do God\'s word and listen to His voice."/\r\n\r\nThese three rewards given to the Jewish people - two Heavenly crowns, being designated as God\'s firstborn child, and being compared to angels - are extremely lofty. What was so extraordinary about the statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma" that caused us to merit receiving these tremendous rewards?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {based on Me\'or Einayim} shares three approaches in understanding what the Jewish people meant when they declared "na\'aseh v\'nishma." Let us examine these three different ways of understanding./\r\n\r\nThe first approach regards the ups and downs that every person experiences during daily life. We must be aware that truly accepting Torah involves doing the will of God not only when we are feeling confident and secure, but also during difficult and challenging times. This is what the Jewish people meant when they said, "Na\'aseh v\'nishma." Their commitment to following the will of God {"na\'aseh"} preceded their understanding of the Torah\'s laws {"nishma"}./\r\n\r\nFailure to understand even logical laws {many of which are found in Parshat Mishpatim} indicates a time of challenge in our lives. The commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains why this is so. The laws in this week\'s parsha seem logical and rational to us not because they are inherently sensible, but because God created us with an innate sense of right and wrong. Since God created us in this way, we have the ability to come close to God and to align ourselves with His will. When a Torah law seems logical to us, it is a sign that we are on the right path - i.e. close to God and aligned with His way of thinking. When we fail to see the rationale behind laws that we have the potential to understand, it is a sign that our behavior has distanced us from our innate sense of right and wrong. The statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma" is therefore a commitment by the Jewish people to follow the Torah\'s laws even at low times, when the laws do not seem sensible to us./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nPARENTAL LOVE/\r\n\r\nThe second approach is based on the Talmud\'s statement {Yoma 28b} that it is possible to serve God even before being commanded to do so. This determines whether we relate to God as a child to a parent, or as a servant to a master. A child, out of love, will do the parent\'s will without being told. A servant, however, will only perform when commanded by his master. God\'s failure to command us indicates distance, as we see in the Talmud\'s statement {Bava Kama 38a}, "Greater is one who is commanded than one who is not commanded./\r\n\r\nWe can suggest a new approach in understanding this idea by means of a parable. Imagine two families. One family insists that the children finish their homework before suppertime, has set bedtimes for the children, imposes curfews, and has all sorts of other rules and expectations. The second family allows the children to eat whenever they want, to stay out as late as they feel like, and does not impose any limitations or boundaries on the children whatsoever. The first family, with its structure and clear expectations, shows that the children\'s well-being is a top priority. The second family, with its total freedom and permissibility, may actually demonstrate a lack of care for the children. When God commands us, He shows that He cares about our well-being. When He does not command us, it can indicate a distance between us.\r\n\r\nThe Jews\' statement of "na\'aseh v\'nishma" can be understood in light of this idea to mean, "We will do even before we are commanded." Despite the Jewish people\'s not being commanded, which could indicate a distance between them and God, they proclaim their intention to fulfill God\'s will anyway. This commitment demonstrates the eternal love a child has for his parent - the desire to fulfill the parent\'s will even when not specifically asked to do so./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nNATURAL EXPRESSION/\r\n\r\nOur performance of God\'s will even at low points in our lives, and even when we feel distant from Him, enables us to attain the highest level, which is the third approach. The Torah\'s 613 commandments correspond to the 613 parts of the physical body, which in turn correspond to the 613 parts of the soul. Just as our bodies do not need to be taught natural drives {eating, drinking, relieving of waste}, so too should the soul be able to perform the will of God naturally, without being taught. However, the body\'s drives prevent the soul from expressing its full potential. Only when we completely purify and refine the body is the soul able to naturally and automatically perform the will of God./\r\n\r\nWhen the Jewish people declared, "Na\'aseh v\'nishma," they implied, "We can do even before hearing the will of God, because we have purified our bodies to the point where expressing the Divine will comes naturally." This purification takes place only when we are committed to performing the will of God even during the low points in our lives and even when we feel distant from the Divine. If we are able to reach this level, we become like angels, who do not have a body that separates them from naturally expressing the Divine will./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nFIRSTBORN CHILD/\r\n\r\nThese three approaches will help us to appreciate the greatness of the Jewish people\'s statement "na\'aseh v\'nishma," and will show us why the Jewish people deserved the three rewards they received. As we mentioned, the people were given two crowns. This reward corresponds to the first approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the commitment to following the will of God not only during times when we feel confident and positive, but also during the low points in life. These two extremes - the highs and the lows - correspond to the two crowns given to the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nThe second reward was God\'s designating the Jewish people as His "firstborn child." This reward corresponds to the second approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the Jews performing the will of God even when not commanded. Although not being commanded could indicate distance, the Jews\' perseverance despite this possibility demonstrated their investment in building a parent/child relationship with God. God then reciprocated with the second reward: calling the Jews "My firstborn child."/\r\n\r\nFor the third reward, the Jewish people were compared to the angels, who are capable of acting before hearing. This reward corresponds to the third approach in understanding "na\'aseh v\'nishma": the Jewish people being able to purify their bodies to such a degree that their souls could express the Divine will without any obstacle. Automatically performing the will of God is an angelic quality; hence, the Jewish people were rewarded by being compared to angels./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to persevere even during the low times, when we feel far away from God, so that we live to be commanded once again in all the mitzvot that depend on the Temple - a time when serving God will come naturally, and we will deserve to be crowned as God\'s only child.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'The Torah encompasses the whole./\r\n\r\nThe second verse of this week\'s parsha is:/\r\n\r\n"Take for Me a donation [to build the Sanctuary]." {Exodus 25:2}/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Midrash {Shmot Rabba 33:1}, this clarifies the verse in Proverbs, "For I have given you a good possession, do not forsake My Torah" {Proverbs 4:2}. The Midrash continues by explaining that God told the Jewish people: Do not forsake the possession that I gave you [Torah]. Sometimes, when people go to purchase precious items, a particular item will contain gold but not silver, or silver but not gold. But the possession that I gave you contains not only silver - as it says, "The words of God are pure words, like purified silver" {Psalms 12:7}, but also gold - as it says, "They [words of Torah] are more desirable than gold and greater than the finest gold" {Psalms 19:11}./\r\n\r\nWe might wonder how the Midrash can compare the holiness of the Torah to mere silver and gold, which, after all, are only material items. Doesn\'t the sanctity of Torah far exceed the value of even the most precious physical objects?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains that Torah is all-inclusive. When an object is made up of many parts, we don\'t view the whole object as merely a compilation of its component details; rather, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. For example, a beam of light is made up of many different colors. These different colors can be individually distinguished when light is focused through a prism. But light is not merely a combination of different colors; it is something much greater than that. The general qualities of light cannot be understood from its component colors alone./\r\n\r\nThis example will help us to understand why the Midrash refers to the Torah as "silver AND gold" as opposed to just "silver" or "gold." We can learn from this phrasing that Torah is inclusive of every possible detail. It contains everything. Moreover, on a deeper level, the Zohar {Trumah 161b} teaches that "God looked into the Torah and from there created the world." In other words, every physical manifestation in the world stems from a spiritual source in Torah. Just as Torah contains silver AND gold, so does it contain the essence of every other attribute and object in the physical world./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nGOD IS GOLD/\r\n\r\nThis idea, on a concrete level, means that the silver we are familiar with in the material world is in fact a physical expression of "spiritual silver." This spiritual silver is love of God. We see a hint to this in the Torah when Lavan confronts Yaakov and says, "You have left because you yearned greatly {nichsof nichsafta} for your father\'s home" {Genesis 31:30}. The root of both these words is kesef, which means "silver." The sense of yearning and longing for a beloved person or place is the spiritual side of silver. In essence, our desire to possess physical silver stems from a deep desire to have a loving relationship with God./\r\n\r\nGold, as well, has a spiritual counterpart. Spiritual gold is fear and awe of God. The verse teaches, "Gold comes from the north" {Job 37:22}. "North" can refer to the uppermost part of the body: the head. Inside the head is where wisdom resides, and the verse tells us, "The beginning of wisdom is the awe of God" {Psalms 111:10}. We can learn from this chain of correlations {gold comes from the north, north refers to the mind, the mind is the place of wisdom, wisdom is called awe} that gold is associated with awe of God. Again, our desire to possess physical gold stems from a deep spiritual desire to develop fear and awe of God./\r\n\r\nThe example of the beam of light that the Ohr Gedaliyahu mentioned above is a particularly appropriate description of Torah. The Baal HaTurim notes {Exodus 25:10} that the letters of the Hebrew word for Ark, aron, can be rearranged to spell the word oran, meaning "their light." This is not merely a play on words; the Ark houses the Torah, hinting to us that the Torah itself can be considered light. Furthermore, the letters of aron can also be rearranged to spell the word nora, meaning "awesome" or "overwhelming." The all-inclusiveness of Torah is awe-inspiring, and through its light, we can come to serve God in totality and completion./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\n613 BODY PARTS/\r\n\r\nTorah is not the only vehicle for achieving completion in Divine service. The Mishkan {Tabernacle} that this week\'s parsha discusses in minute detail is also greater than the sum of its parts, and can inspire us to serve God in totality. The Zohar and the Midrash Ne\'elam both state that the 613 parts of the Mishkan directly correlate to the 613 parts of the human body. For example, the Menorah corresponds to the eyes; the Table that held the showbreads corresponds to the mouth; the incense Altar corresponds to the nose, and so on./\r\n\r\nWe would do well to learn the message of the Mishkan and join all 613 parts of ourselves together in order to serve God in totality. Although it is critical to pay attention to guarding our speech, or seeing only good in others, we must not get so absorbed in the details of self-growth that we lose sight of the big picture./\r\n\r\nThis is why the Midrash connects the donation to build the Mishkan and the verse in Proverbs, "Do not forsake My Torah." Both the Mishkan and the Torah are composed of many details, yet both are far more than the sum of their parts. The goal is integration. When all the disparate elements of ourselves join together and form one complete unit, we can serve God in totality.',

    vort: 'In this week\'s portion, we find a detailed description of the eight garments worn by the High Priest: the .breastplate/ .apron/ .robe/ .cloak/ .hat/ .sash/ .tzitz {a golden plate worn on the forehead}, and pants {Exodus 28:4, 28:36, 28:42}./ The parsha continues by describing the animal offerings of the Tabernacle./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Arachin 16a} questions the logic behind this juxtaposition. What is the connection between the priestly garments and the animal offerings?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, both bring about atonement. The Talmud elaborates on this idea by listing the symbolism of each garment:/\r\n\r\nThe cloak, reminiscent of Yosef\'s cloak, atones for the crime of murder./\r\n\r\nThe pants, designated to cover nakedness, atone for the crime of immorality./\r\n\r\nThe hat, symbolizing haughtiness, atones for pride./\r\n\r\nThe sash, covering the trunk of the body, atones for illicit thoughts of the heart./\r\n\r\nThe breastplate {"choshen mishpat"} atones for judgments {"mishpat"} that are false or corrupt./\r\n\r\nThe apron atones for idolatry./\r\n\r\nThe robe, with its pleasant-sounding bells at the hem, atones for the negative sound of evil speech {"lashon hara"}./\r\n\r\nThe tzitz atones for brazenness./\r\nThe commentator Kli Yakar explains that these eight types of incorrect behavior can be subdivided into two categories. Idolatry, immorality, murder, and loshon hara are severe crimes in and of themselves, while the remaining behaviors - judicial corruption, pride, immoral thoughts, and brazenness - are generally undesirable traits that cause other sins to be committed./\r\n\r\nYet all this categorization still does not help us resolve the fundamental question: how can the garments of the High Priest atone for the Jewish people?/\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nOCEAN WAVES/\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this issue, we must clarify the mechanism at work. When the Torah promises us benefits for fulfilling mitzvot, it is not describing an automatic process of reward. Wearing the priestly garments with no awareness of their power would cause no effect at all. The Torah teaches us the potential for good that is contained within every mitzvah - but actualizing that potential takes hard work. We must change ourselves for the better, and only then will the circumstances around us change./\r\n\r\nWe see one example of this in the description of the High Priest\'s robe, which atones for the sin of loshon hara. The Torah states {Exodus 28:31} that the robe must be made entirely of techeilet {turquoise}, a color that the Talmud {Menachot 43b} likens to the sea. We can extrapolate from this description that the sea can teach us how to curb our tongues from improper speech. The enormous waves of the ocean come speeding in with great force - yet ultimately they crash at the shore and dissolve. This reminds us of the verse in the Book of Job {38:10-11}, "I have put a bar and doors on it; come to this point {"ad po"} and go no further." The word po {"this point"} is spelled identically to the word peh, which means "mouth." Thus, the Kli Yakar suggests that the turquoise color of the priest\'s robe reminds us of ocean waves, which in turn teach us not to overstep boundaries in our speech./\r\n\r\nWe see this also in the Torah\'s instruction to reinforce the opening of the robe {Exodus 28:32}. The words used in this instruction {"Safah yihiyeh l\'fiv saviv"} can be translated literally as, "There should be lips to your mouth" - meaning that we should use the "bar and doors" we have been given {teeth and lips} to prevent our tongue from bursting out and speaking negative or unnecessary words. Furthermore, the hem of the priestly robe is adorned with small bells {Exodus 28:34} that jingle as the High Priest moves about and performs his service. The bells can be compared to a mouth, with the clapper symbolizing a tongue, serving as an additional caution to watch what we say./\r\n\r\nFinally, at the end of the description of the robe, the Torah states, "And he [the High Priest] will not die" {Exodus 28:35}. Why would the Torah specifically mention this detail in reference to the robe? We can understand this verse based on the midrashic statement that loshon hara kills three people: the speaker, the listener, and the party being spoken about {Devarim Rabba}. If we internalize the lesson of the robe, and withhold ourselves from improper speech, we can save all three parties from death./\r\n\r\nThe example of the robe shows that the lessons of the garments must be brought into reality and used to improve ourselves in order to achieve atonement. Judaism is not just a game, where a given thought or action will magically bring about the desired effect. We must strive to truly internalize the messages of the mitzvot and make them manifest through focused, positive action. Only in this way can we reap the benefits of their potential./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to cultivate this outlook on mitzvot, so that we can develop a complete picture of Torah, combining our knowledge of the details and technicalities with an understanding of the deep opportunity for self-improvement contained within every action.',

    vort: "This week's Torah portion describes the infamous Golden Calf. When Moses prays to God to forgive the Jewish people for this incident, he pleads, \"Blot me out of Your Book\" {Exodus 32:32}. The implication of this statement is that Moses's erasure from the Torah would somehow atone for the Jewish people's sin. We know that Moses was the humblest man who ever lived, which makes this statement seem quite surprising. The Golden Calf was a major offense. How could Moses be so presumptuous to think that removing his name from the Torah could atone for the entire fiasco?/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Baal Shem Tov, whenever Moses saw the Jewish people behaving inappropriately, he blamed himself. He assumed that his own failings were the most probable cause of the people's misbehavior. This attitude can be understood on two levels. On a Kabbalistic level, if the leader of a generation makes even a slight mistake, it can cause a ripple effect. A leader's small error in thought, speech or action may result in the people's committing major crimes./\r\n\r\nThe Mekor Mayim Chaim writes that this effect can be compared to a person holding a long piece of string, with the top end between his fingers and the bottom lying on the ground. If the person moves the top of the string even slightly, the bottom will move as well. The top of the string - the \"head\" - symbolizes the head of the generation. Just as the head of the string causes the bottom to move, so too does the head of the generation impact those lower down./\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, we can understand Moses's behavior as covering for the Jewish people. He took responsibility for their mistake because of his intense commitment to leading them. It is as if Moses said, \"Had I been a better leader, they would have been better people.\" He saw their mistake as a reflection on his failure to guide them properly./\r\n\r\nIn fact, this was not the case, as we see in God's subsequent statement, \"The one who really sinned to me I will blot out of My Book\" {Exodus 32:33}. Moses was completely guiltless in this situation. Yet we see that Moses was nevertheless prepared to cover for the people by taking the blame himself./\r\n\r\nNow we can understand Moses's plea to be taken out of the Torah. Moses was not being presumptuous by claiming that his erasure from the Torah would atone for the people's sin; rather, he was begging, \"Punish me instead of them!\" A willingness to cover for other people - deflecting the accusations against them and accepting the blame ourselves - is one of the greatest ways to demonstrate love./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to love each other to the degree where we can point the accusatory finger at ourselves instead of at others. In this way, may we be able to rectify our old mistake of baseless hatred, and replace it with baseless love, that we may merit our full and final redemption.",

    vort: "In this week's parsha, Moses tells the Jewish people that God has appointed Betzalel as chief craftsman to build the Tabernacle {Exodus 35:30}. The Talmud {Brachot 55a} explains that Betzalel got this position due to his great wisdom, as follows: Although God initially commanded Moses to build the Tabernacle and only afterwards commanded him to build the Ark, when Moses told Betzalel what to build, he reversed the order of these instructions./\r\n\r\nBetzalel questioned Moses about this order. If the way of the world is to first build a home and only then fill it with furniture, why would it make sense to build the furniture before the structure? Perhaps God had commanded the Tabernacle and the Ark to be built in a different order? Moses saw from this insight that Betzalel was aligned with God's knowledge, and that the name Betzalel {from the words \"b'tzel E-l,\" meaning, \"in the shadow of God\"} was fitting for him./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Shmot Rabba 50:2} has a seemingly contradictory perspective on these events. According to the Midrash, the verse, \"Betzalel made the Ark\" {Exodus 37:1} clarifies the verse in Proverbs {9:9} that states, \"Give to a wise person, and he increases wisdom.\" How is this verse a reference to Betzalel?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that when Moses told Betzalel to build the Tabernacle, Betzalel asked him about the nature of it. Moses replied that the Tabernacle would be a place for the Divine Presence to rest, from which God would teach Torah to the Jewish people. Betzalel inquired where the Torah would be placed. Moses explained that the Tabernacle would be built first, and afterwards the Ark would be crafted, in which to put the Torah. Betzalel replied that this was not honorable to the Torah; therefore, he would make the Ark first./\r\n\r\nThis Midrash seems to blatantly contradict the Talmudic passage we mentioned above. Which structure was built first, the Tabernacle or the Ark, and what were the reasons for that order?/\r\n\r\nThe Shem MiShmuel proposes an insight. In his view, there are two approaches in serving God. The approach that is suitable for most people is to study Torah first, so that eventually the intellectual knowledge we acquire will enable us to correct our undesirable character traits. In other words, we must first fill the mind with an awareness of God, and then infuse that awareness into the limbs of our body to perfect our behavior./\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the second approach is applicable only to an elite few. In this method, we sanctify our behavior first, working to eliminate any character flaws we may have and exerting ourselves to perfect our actions. Only after we have done this do we merit to be filled with Torah./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nMIND AND BODY/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can begin to resolve the contradiction between the order of events in the Talmud and the Midrash. Let us first understand the connection between the two structures we mentioned before {Tabernacle and Ark} and the two elements that the Shem MiShmuel discusses {mind and body}. The Tabernacle, which was built using physical labor and craftsmanship, represents the physical control of the limbs. The Ark, on the other hand, where the Torah is placed, represents the intellectual pursuit of Torah knowledge./\r\n\r\nThe Torah portions of Trumah and Vayakhel both deal with the construction of the Tabernacle. Although Parshat Trumah precedes this week's parsha of Vayakhel in the Torah itself, the commentator Levush HaOra {Exodus 38:22} writes that the events of Parshat Trumah chronologically took place after Parshat Vayakhel. We learn this from the first verse of this week's portion: \"And Moses gathered the people\" {Exodus 35:1}. Rashi states that this gathering took place the day after Yom Kippur, when Moses returned to the people and informed them that they could achieve atonement for the Golden Calf by building of the Tabernacle. This is when Moses mentioned the Tabernacle first and the Ark second. At a later date, in Parshat Trumah, Moses taught the people all the details that the Tabernacle should contain - mentioning the Ark first and the Tabernacle second./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Zohar, Moses was pursued by forces of evil from the time of his youth. He had to exert himself tremendously to refine his actions and behavior. Only after he had perfected his character did he merit to receive the awareness and understanding of Torah. This is why he initially tells the people in Parshat Vayakhel to build the Tabernacle first. The Tabernacle represents physical action and behavioral change - the approach that is appropriate only for an elite few./\r\n\r\nThis approach resonated with Moses, since it is the approach he lived. The Midrash, in which Moses mentions building the Tabernacle first, is therefore referring to the instructions given in Parshat Vayakhel. Betzalel's objection - that it would dishonor the Torah to build the Tabernacle first - implies that there is an alternative method of drawing close to God. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for the people to follow a different pattern./\r\n\r\nApparently, Moses agreed with Betzalel's assessment. In his subsequent address to the people, in Parshat Trumah, he reversed the order of the building instructions, mentioning the Ark first. This is the approach to which the Talmud refers, when Moses tells Betzalel to build the Ark before the Tabernacle. As mentioned, the Ark represents intellectual awareness. The approach where awareness precedes major behavioral refinement is more appropriate for the masses. Betzalel's question here is not merely logical {why would one build the furniture before the house?} but also because Moses's previous instructions were in the reverse order. Why did Moses change the order? Moses sees from this question that Betzalel is truly intent on performing God's will and is therefore fittingly named./\r\n\r\nWe see from here that there is no contradiction between the Talmud and the Midrash. The Talmud is referring to the approach of Parshat Trumah, where the Ark {awareness} comes before the Tabernacle {action}. This approach is the more common one. The Midrash is referring to the approach of Parshat Vayakhel, where the Tabernacle {action} comes before the Ark {awareness} - an approach that is appropriate only for an elite few./\r\n\r\nMay we each merit to find our unique connection to God, and may we soon merit to serve God in totality, with the building of the Ark and the Temple.",

    vort: 'Moving forward, during the light and the darkness./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s Torah portion concludes the Book of Exodus by describing the construction of the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the priestly garments. The Midrash {Tanchuma 11} states two opinions regarding the seven-day inauguration of the Tabernacle. According to Rebbe Chiya ben Yosef, Moses dissembled and reassembled the Tabernacle twice a day during the inauguration. This is deduced from the repetition of the word "to erect," which appears in the forms "takim" {Exodus 40:2} and "hukam" {Exodus 40:17}. How could the Tabernacle be erected again once it was already built? According to Rebbe Chiya, the repetition of this word implies that Moses took the Tabernacle apart and then rebuilt it./\r\n\r\nRebbe Chanina adds to Rebbe Chiya\'s opinion by noting the word "vayakem" {Exodus 40:18}, which is from the same root word "to erect." Rebbe Chanina therefore claims that Moses dissembled and reassembled the Tabernacle three times a day! By now, the question is obvious: why was it necessary for Moses to continually take apart and rebuild the Tabernacle?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe uses this Midrash to teach us a vital lesson. Although we spend our lives toiling and struggling to build ourselves into sanctuaries - vessels worthy for the Divine Presence to rest within - there still may be times that we stumble and fall. Despite these low periods, however, we must never give up hope. Rather, we must rouse ourselves immediately and continue to strengthen and build ourselves, because it is forbidden for a Jew to fall into despair./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nTWICE A DAY/\r\n\r\nWe see this lesson expressed in Rebbe Chiya ben Yosef\'s opinion that Moses dismantled and rebuilt the Tabernacle twice a day. These two times correspond to morning and evening: the bright time and the dark time of the day. We could suggest that the message being conveyed here is to move forward not only during the bright, easy times of life, but also when circumstances are dark and difficult. No matter what the situation, our task is to build ourselves and continue to grow./\r\n\r\nRebbe Chanina\'s opinion - that Moses rebuilt the Tabernacle three times a day - also hints to this idea. If the Tabernacle was dismantled three times a day for all seven days of the inauguration, then it was taken apart and put back together a total of 21 times. Twenty-one is the numerical value of the word "ehyeh," which means, "I will be." When God revealed Himself to Moses at the Burning Bush, this is the Name that He asked Moses to tell the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nGod\'s description of Himself as "Ehyeh asher ehyeh" - literally, "I will be what I will be" {Exodus 3:14} - can be interpreted to mean, "I will be with a person who says I will be." Even after we stumble and fall, God is with us when we choose to continue on the path of growth rather than sinking into hopelessness./\r\n\r\nThe statement "Ehyeh asher ehyeh" also hints to the value of the word "ehyeh" multiplied by itself, resulting in 441. This is the same numerical value as the word "emet," which means "truth." We can suggest that a person who cultivates an attitude of continual growth, even during difficult times, will eventually come to truth./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to never give up, even after falling two or three or 21 times, by having confidence in ourselves and realizing that the fall is part of the climb. By doing so, may we build ourselves into a sanctuary, and merit to witness the rebuilding of the ultimate sanctuary, our Holy Temple in Jerusalem.',

    vort: 'This week\'s Torah portion begins with God speaking to Moses {Leviticus 1:1}. Rashi points out that God addresses Moses with the word "vayikra," whereas in Parshat Balak {Numbers 23:4} God speaks to the gentile prophet, Bilam, with the word "vayikar." Although these two words are almost identical, the word "vayikra" comes from the root word "to call," whereas the word "vayikar" comes from the root word "to happen." What does this difference in terminology signify?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Shem MiShmuel explains that God did not call to Bilam with affection; rather, He simply chanced upon him and happened to speak to him. But the word "vayikar" also has a deeper significance in the story of Bilam. According to the Shem MiShmuel, Bilam\'s experience communicating with the Divine was just something that happened - just another event in his life. Speaking with God did not change Bilam or move him to grow in any way; it simply happened to take place./\r\n\r\nBilam wanted the best of both worlds. He wanted to be close to God, but, at the same time, he was not willing to change any aspect of his lifestyle. Although Bilam claims that he wishes to die the death of the righteous {Numbers 23:10}, it is clear from his conduct that he has no intention of compromising his behavior in order to reach this goal. Yet the point of Torah is to make a difference and spur us to growth. Surface knowledge that doesn\'t make a difference in our lives is almost worthless. The true value of Torah is revealed when we allow it to penetrate, and when we use that wisdom to change our lives./\r\n\r\nAccording to our tradition, the word vayikra is written in a Torah scroll with a small letter aleph. Although the text is ambiguous regarding who exactly called to Moses, this letter makes it quite clear. Aleph is spelled the same way as the word aluf, which means "chief." Furthermore, the letter aleph itself is composed of one long line and two short lines, which resemble a vav and two yuds. The numerical value of these component letters is 26 - the same numerical value as God\'s four-letter Name. Thus, the aleph teaches us that the Chief {aluf} of the World {i.e. God, numerically 26} is ultimately One: the numerical value of the letter aleph./\r\n\r\nWhen we use Torah to grow, we have the opportunity to elevate ourselves and become God-like. It was God who called to Moses, calling to him with love: "Come here! Come close! Grow toward Me!"/\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to hear our calling in life, and may our knowledge penetrate below the surface and make a difference in how we live our lives.',

    vort: "Good leaders know their own limits. They do not try to do it all themselves. They build teams. They create space for people who are strong where they are weak. They understand the importance of checks and balances and the separation of powers. They surround themselves with people who are different from them. They understand the danger of concentrating all power in a single individual. But learning your limits, knowing there are things you cannot do – even things you cannot be – can be a painful experience. Sometimes it involves an emotional crisis./\r\n\r\nThe Torah contains four fascinating accounts of such moments. What links them is not words but music. From quite early on in Jewish history, the Torah was sung, not just read. Moses at the end of his life calls the Torah a song.1 Different traditions grew up in Israel and Babylon, and from around the tenth century onward the chant began to be systematised in the form of the musical notations known as ta’amei ha-mikra, cantillation signs, devised by the Tiberian Masoretes {guardians of Judaism’s sacred texts}. One very rare note, known as a shalshelet {chain}, appears in the Torah four times only. Each time it is a sign of existential crisis. Three instances are in the book of Genesis. The fourth is in our parsha. As we will see, the fourth is about leadership. In a broad sense, the other three are as well./\r\n\r\nThe first instance occurs in the story of Lot. Aftet Lot separated from his uncle Abraham he settled in Sodom. There he assimilated into the local population. His daughters married local men. He himself sat in the city gate, a sign that he had been made a Judge. Then two visitors come to tell him to leave, for God is about to destroy the city. Yet Lot hesitates, and above the word for “hesitates” – vayitmamah – is a shalshelet. {Gen. 19:16}. Lot is torn, conflicted. He senses that the visitors are right. The city is indeed about to be destroyed. But he has invested his whole future in the new identity he has been carving out for himself and his daughters. The angels then forcibly take him out of the city to safety – had they not done so, he would have delayed until it was too late./\r\n\r\nThe second shalshelet occurs when Abraham asks his servant – traditionally identified as Eliezer – to find a wife for Isaac his son. The commentators suggest that Eliezer felt a profound ambivalence about his mission. Were Isaac not to marry and have children, Abraham's estate would eventually pass to Eliezer or his descendants. Abraham had already said so before Isaac was born: “Sovereign Lord, what can You give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” {Gen. 15:2}. If Eliezer succeeded in his mission, bringing back a wife for Isaac, and if the couple had children, then his chances of one day acquiring Abraham’s wealth would disappear completely. Two instincts warred within him: loyalty to Abraham and personal ambition. The verse states: “And he said: Lord, the God of my master Abraham, send me…good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham” {Gen. 24:12}. Eliezer’s loyalty to Abraham won, but not without a deep struggle. Hence the shalshelet {Gen. 24:12}./\r\n\r\nThe third shalshalet brings us to Egypt and the life of Joseph. Sold by his brothers as a slave, he is now working in the house of an eminent Egyptian, Potiphar. Left alone in the house with his master’s wife, he finds himself the object of her desire. He is handsome. She wants him to sleep with her. He refuses. To do such a thing, he says, would be to betray his master, her husband. It would be a sin against God. Yet over “he refused” is a shalshelet, {Genesis 39:8} indicating – as some rabbinic sources and mediaeval commentaries suggest – that he did so at the cost of considerable effort.2 He nearly succumbed. This was more than the usual conflict between sin and temptation. It was a conflict of identity. Recall that Joseph was living in a new and strange land. His brothers had rejected him. They had made it clear that they did not want him as part of their family. Why then should he not, in Egypt, do as the Egyptians do? Why not yield to his master's wife if that is what she wanted? The question for Joseph was not just, “Is this right?” but also, “Am I an Egyptian or a Jew?”/\r\n\r\nAll three episodes are about inner conflict, and all three are about identity. There are times when each of us has to decide, not just “What shall I do?” but “What kind of person shall I be?” That is particularly fateful in the case of a leader, which brings us to episode four, this time with Moses in the central role./\r\n\r\nAfter the sin of the Golden Calf, Moses had, at God’s command instructed the Israelites to build a Sanctuary which would be, in effect, a permanent symbolic home for God in the midst of the people. By now the work is complete and all that remains is for Moses to induct his brother Aaron and Aaron’s sons into office. He robes Aaron with the special garments of the High Priest, anoints him with oil, and performs the various sacrifices appropriate to the occasion. Over the word vayishchat, “and he slaughtered [the sacrificial ram]” {Lev. 8:23} there is a shalshelet. By now we know that this means there was an internal struggle in Moses’ mind. But what was it? There is not the slightest sign in the text that suggests that he was undergoing a crisis./\r\n\r\nYet a moment's thought makes it clear what Moses’ inner turmoil was about. Until now he had led the Jewish people. Aaron had assisted him, accompanying him on his missions to Pharaoh, acting as his spokesman, aide and second-in-command. Now, however, Aaron was about to undertake a new leadership role in his own right. No longer would he be one step behind Moses. He would do what Moses himself could not. He would preside over the daily offerings in the Tabernacle. He would mediate the avodah, the Israelites’ sacred service to God. Once a year on Yom Kippur he would perform the service that would secure atonement for the people from its sins. No longer in Moses’ shadow, Aaron was about to become the one kind of leader Moses was not destined to be: a High Priest./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud adds a further dimension to the poignancy of the moment. At the Burning Bush, Moses had repeatedly resisted God’s call to lead the people. Eventually God told him that Aaron would go with him, helping him speak {Ex. 4:14-16}. The Talmud says that at that moment Moses lost the chance to be a Priest: “Originally [said God] I had intended that you would be the Priest and Aaron your brother would be a Levite. Now he will be the Priest and you will be a Levite.”3/\r\n\r\nThat is Moses’ inner struggle, conveyed by the shalshelet. He is about to induct his brother into an office he himself will never hold. Things might have been otherwise – but life is not lived in the world of “might have been.” He surely feels joy for his brother, but he cannot altogether avoid a sense of loss. Perhaps he already senses what he will later discover, that though he was the prophet and liberator, Aaron will have a privilege Moses will be denied, namely, seeing his children and their descendants inherit his role. The son of a Priest is a Priest. The son of a Prophet is rarely a Prophet./\r\n\r\nWhat all four stories tell us is that there comes a time for each of us when we must make an ultimate decision as to who we are. It is a moment of existential truth. Lot is a Hebrew, not a citizen of Sodom. Eliezer is Abraham’s servant, not his heir. Joseph is Jacob’s son, not an Egyptian of loose morals. Moses is a Prophet, not a Priest. To say ‘Yes’ to who we are, we have to have the courage to say ‘No’ to who we are not. Pain and struggle is always involved in this type of conflict. That is the meaning of the shalshelet. But we emerge less conflicted than we were before./\r\n\r\nThis applies especially to leaders, which is why the case of Moses in our parsha is so important. There were things Moses was not destined to do. He would never become a Priest. That task fell to Aaron. He would never lead the people across the Jordan. That was Joshua’s role. Moses had to accept both facts with good grace if he was to be honest with himself. And great leaders must be honest with themselves if they are to be honest with those they lead./\r\n\r\nA leader should never try to be all things to all people. A leader should be content to be who they are. Leaders must have the strength to know what they cannot be if they are to have the courage to be truly their best selves.",

    vort: "This week's Torah portion contains the dramatic story of Nadav and Avihu, two of Aaron's sons, who bring a strange offering to God. This is so unacceptable that a fire consumes them on the spot and they die. The Midrash {Yalkut Shimoni 524} suggests seven reasons why Aaron's sons might have deserved death:/\r\n\r\nNadav and Avihu were impatient for Moses and Aaron to die so that they could take over leadership of the Jewish people./\r\n1. They made Jewish legal decisions in front of Moses, their rabbi, a sign of disrespect./\r\n2. They entered the holy area while intoxicated./\r\n3. They entered the holy area without first washing their hands and feet./\r\n4. They entered the holy area without wearing the priestly garments./\r\n5. They did not get married./\r\n6. They did not try to have children./\r\nAlthough these reasons seem entirely unrelated, we could suggest that all seven of them stem from one fundamental fault. Nadav and Avihu were great people, and they were aware of their high spiritual level. Yet they felt they had already reached the pinnacle of their achievement, and therefore had no need to strive for further growth and self-improvement. This misjudgment was the root of all seven possible reasons for their death:/\r\n\r\n1. Nadav and Avihu felt they had reached completion and perfection, so it seemed fitting for them to take over leadership of the Jewish people./\r\n2. They felt they had achieved the epitome of Torah knowledge, so they made Jewish legal decisions in front of their rabbi./\r\n3. Since they assumed they had reached their maximum potential, they felt they could relax, so they entered the holy area while intoxicated./\r\n4. Since they felt they had reached the height of purity, they no longer needed water to become purified, so they entered the holy area without first washing their hands and feet./\r\n5. Since they felt they had achieved perfection, they no longer needed the atonement provided by the priestly garments {Arachin 16a}, so they entered the holy area without wearing them./\r\n6. They assumed that, since they had perfected themselves, God could speak with them at any time - as He did with Moses, who separated from his wife, Tzipporah, due to this consideration {Numbers 12:7-8} - so they did not get married./\r\n7. Since they did not get married, they were halachically forbidden from having children outside of marriage./\r\n* * */\r\nTHE MEASURE OF A MAN/\r\n\r\nNow that we see the common source of the seven reasons, let us examine another detail of the story. The Torah tells us {Leviticus 10:2} that a fire consumed Nadav and Avihu after they brought their strange offering. According to the Yalkut Shimoni {524}, this fire came from the Holy of Holies. Why is it relevant to know the source of the fire?/\r\n\r\nThe Holy of Holies contained only one vessel: the Holy Ark. Unlike the other Temple vessels, the dimensions of the Ark were all fractions - 2.5 by 1.5 by 1.5 cubits {Exodus 25:10}. According to the commentator Kli Yakar, the fractional measurements of the Ark teach us that we should always feel lacking in regards to the wisdom we have acquired. Each of the Ark's dimensions teaches us a different dimension of this lesson. The height of the Ark shows us that we lack depth of knowledge; the length shows us that we lack breadth of knowledge; and the width shows us that we lack the ability to grasp concepts./\r\n\r\nIn Hebrew, the same word midot means both \"measurements\" and \"character traits.\" This is why the fire that consumed Nadav and Avihu came from the Holy of Holies: the resting place of the Ark. The Ark, with its fractional measurements {midot} teaches us that we, too, are fractional - lacking in Torah knowledge and imperfect in our refinement of character {midot}. Nadav and Avihu thought that they had reached completion. The origin of the fire that consumed them showed that they still had work to do./\r\n\r\nIf this lesson was relevant to such great people as Nadav and Avihu, it is all the more relevant to us. Although we should take pleasure in our positive achievements, we should never take pride. We should not feel so satisfied with our accomplishments that we lose our yearning to stretch and grow further./\r\n\r\nMay we continually desire to push beyond our current level, and in the merit of this attitude, may we soon deserve to see the return of our centerpiece, the Ark, with the building of the Third Temple.",

    vort: 'This week\'s Torah portion primarily deals with the phenomenon of a "negah" - a physical skin disease that expresses a spiritual ailment. The Sefer Yetzirah {2:7} states that there is nothing greater than "oneg" {delight} and nothing lower than "negah." How are we to understand this enigmatic remark?/\r\nThe Midrash Socher Tov {citing Rebbe Yitzchak on Psalm 92} notes that all aspects of Shabbat are doubled. In the Holy Temple, the meal offering consisted of a double portion {Exodus 16:22}; the animal offerings consisted of two lambs {Numbers 29:9}; the punishment for desecrating Shabbat is described with double wording {Exodus 31:14}; the reward for observing Shabbat contains double wording {Isaiah 58:13}; the commandment to observe Shabbat appears in two forms, "zachor" {Exodus 20:8} and "shamor" {Deut. 5:12}; and the Psalm that was sung on Shabbat has two names, "mizmor" and "shir" {Psalms 92:1}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Shem MiShmuel, the Midrash is not merely mentioning that Shabbat is associated with double expressions. Rather, we learn from here that the very essence of Shabbat is twofold. On one hand, Shabbat is called the "secret of oneness" {Zohar}, through which all Jews are equated. On the other hand, Shabbat is likened to the Coming World, where every righteous person receives reward based on his individual merit {see Shmot Rabba 52:3 and Shabbat 152a}. The Shem MiShmuel explains these two aspects as follows:/\r\n\r\nAll Jewish people are equal when it comes to refraining from transgressions. In passivity, we are all alike. This is the first aspect of Shabbat - the oneness in which all Jews are equated. The other aspect of Shabbat, as we mentioned, is where each person receives reward based on individual merit. This refers to the mitzvot that require action to fulfill. Far from being equated in this realm, we each grow differently depending on how much energy, sincerity, and pure intention we put into our performance of mitzvot./\r\n\r\nWe can broaden this discussion and suggest that the Jewish people have a dual mission. We have a unified, national mission, in which we are all equated. However, each individual has a unique, specific mission as well - a mission that is different from everyone else\'s./\r\n\r\nTypically, the idea of a personal mission is understood to mean using our individual talents to bring something unique into the world. Based on the Shem MiShmuel, we now see that we can also fulfill our individual mission through our performance of mitzvot. Although everyone\'s actions might appear to be identical, in reality, each person performs mitzvot with a different degree of enthusiasm and care.\r\n\r\nThe "metzora" - the one smitten with a spiritual skin disease - is disqualified from both his national and his individual mission. The Torah tells us {Leviticus 13:46} that the metzora dwells alone, which the Talmud {Arachin 16b} understands to mean "outside the Jewish camp." This enforced solitude symbolizes the metzora\'s disqualification from the Jewish people\'s national purpose./\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we learn that the metzora is locked away for a week {Leviticus 13:4} or sometimes two weeks {Leviticus 13:5}. This shows us that different people require different amounts of time to extricate themselves from their spiritual degradation. The amount of time necessary for each metzora to heal is based on the unique way he developed his corrupt behavior. This demonstrates the ruination of the metzora\'s individual mission, since the time it takes him to heal is directly based on how much effort he put into performing transgressions./\r\n\r\nNow we can finally understand the comment from the Sefer Yetzirah that there is nothing greater than oneg and nothing lower than negah. {This is a play on words: both are composed of the three letters ayin, nun, gimmel.} The word oneg is frequently used in association with Shabbat. Nothing is greater than the oneg of Shabbat because, as we stated, the essence of Shabbat is twofold. Shabbat fully expresses both the national and the individual purpose of the Jewish people, thus symbolizing serving God in totality and completion. Negah, on the other hand, symbolizes the utter degradation of the metzora, who is disqualified from both his national and individual mission. Nothing could be lower than this inability to fulfill one\'s purpose on any level./\r\n\r\nMay we all be doubly blessed to live up to our national and individual missions, thereby enabling us to serve God in totality and completion.',

    vort: "The Sages were eloquent on the subject of lashon hara, evil speech, the sin they took to be the cause of tsara’at. But there is a meta-halachic principle: “From the negative you can infer the positive”1 So, for example, from the seriousness of the prohibition against Chillul Hashem, desecrating God’s name, one can infer the importance of the opposite, Kiddush Hashem, sanctifying God’s name./\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that alongside the grave sin of lashon hara, there must in principle be a concept of lashon hatov, good speech, and it must be more than a mere negation of its opposite. The way to avoid lashon hara is to practise silence, and indeed the Sages were eloquent on the important of silence.2 Silence saves us from evil speech but in and of itself it achieves nothing positive. What then is lashon hatov?\r\n\r\nOne of the most important tasks of a leader, a parent or a friend is focused praise. We first discussed this idea in parshat Vayeshev, where we examined the classic text on this – a Mishnah in Tractate Avot {2:11} in which Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai enumerates the praises of his five beloved students:/\r\n\r\nEliezer ben Hyrcanus: a plastered well that never loses a drop. Joshua ben Chananya: happy the one who gave him birth. Yose the Priest: a pious man. Shimon ben Netanel: a man who fears sin. Elazar ben Arach: an ever-flowing spring./\r\n\r\nEvery Rabbi had disciples. The imperative, “Raise up many disciples”3 is one of the oldest rabbinic teachings on record. What the Mishnah is telling us here is how to create disciples. It is not difficult to create followers. Often a good teacher will, over time, notice that they have developed a large following, students who are uncritical devotees – but how to encourage these followers to become creative intellects in their own right? It is far harder to create leaders than to create followers./\r\n\r\nRabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was a great teacher because five of his students became giants in their own right. The Mishnah is telling us how he did it: with focussed praise. He showed each of his pupils where their particular strength lay. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, the “plastered well that never loses a drop,” was gifted with a superb memory – an important ability in an age in which manuscripts were rare and the Oral Law was not yet committed to writing. Shimon ben Netanel, the “man who fears sin,” may not have had the intellectual brilliance of the others but his reverential nature was a reminder to others that they were not merely scholars but also holy men engaged in a sacred task. Elazar ben Arach, the “ever-flowing spring,” had a creative mind constantly giving rise to new interpretations of ancient texts./\r\n\r\nI discovered the transformative power of focused praise from one of the more remarkable people I ever met, the late Lena Rustin. Lena was a speech therapist, specialising in helping children who struggled with stammers. I came to know her through a television documentary I was making for the BBC about the state of the family in Britain. Lena believed that the young children she was treating – they were, on average, around five years old – had to be understood in the context of their families. Families tend to develop an equilibrium. If a child stammers, everyone in the family adjusts to it. Therefore if the child is to lose their stammer, all the relationships within the family will have to be renegotiated. Not only must the child change. So must everyone else./\r\n\r\nBy and large, we tend to resist change. We settle into patterns of behaviour as they become more and more comfortable, like a well-used armchair or a well-worn pair of shoes. How do you create an atmosphere within a family that encourages change and makes it unthreatening? The answer Lena discovered was praise. She told the families with whom she was working that every day they must notice each member of the family doing something right, and say so – specifically, positively and thankfully./\r\n\r\nShe did not go into deep explanations, but watching her at work I began to realise what she was doing. She was creating, within each home, an atmosphere of mutual regard and continuous positive reinforcement. She wanted the parents to shape an environment of self-respect and self-confidence, not just for the stammering child but for every member of the family, so that the entire atmosphere of the home was one in which people felt safe to change and help others to do so./\r\n\r\nI suddenly realised that Lena had discovered a solution not just for stammering but for group dynamics as a whole. My intuition was soon confirmed in a surprising way. There had been tensions among the television crew with which I had been working. Various things had gone wrong and there was an atmosphere of mutual recrimination. After filming a session of Lena Rustin teaching parents how to give and receive praise, the crew likewise began praising one another. Instantly the atmosphere was transformed. The tension dissolved, and filming became fun again. Praise gives people the confidence to let go of the negative aspects of their character and reach their full potential./\r\n\r\nThere is in praise a deep spiritual message too. We think religion is about faith in God. What I had not fully understood before was that faith in God should lead us to have faith in people, for God’s image is in each of us, and we have to learn how to discern it. I then understood that the repeated phrase in Genesis 1, “And God saw that it was good,” was there to teach us to see the good in people and events, and by so doing, help to strengthen that goodness. I also understood why God briefly punished Moses by turning his hand to tsara’at – because he had said about the Israelites, “They will not believe in me.” {Ex. 4:1} Moses was being taught a fundamental lesson of leadership: It does not matter whether they believe in you. What matters is that you believe in them./\r\n\r\nIt was from another wise woman that I learned another important lesson about praise. Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, in her book Mindset4, argues that it makes a decisive difference whether we believe that our abilities are innate and determined once and for all {the “fixed” mindset}, or whether we may assume that talent is something we achieve through time by effort, practice and persistence {the “growth” mindset}. People who take the former approach tend to be risk-averse, afraid that if they fail this will show that they are not as good as they were thought to be. The latter group embrace risk because they take failure as a learning experience from which they can grow. It follows that there is good praise and bad praise. Parents and teachers should not praise children in absolute terms: “You are gifted, brilliant, a star!” They should praise effort: “You tried hard, you gave of your best, and I can see the improvement!” They should encourage a growth mindset, not a fixed one./\r\n\r\nPerhaps this explains a sad aftermath in the life of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai’s two most gifted pupils. The Mishnah immediately following the one quoted above states:/\r\n\r\nHe [Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai] used to say: If all the Sages of Israel were in one scale of a balance and Eliezer ben Hyrcanus in the other, he would outweigh them all. However, Abba Saul said in his name: If all the Sages of Israel, including Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, were in one scale of a balance, and Elazar ben Arach in the other, he would outweigh them all. {Avot 2:12}/\r\n\r\nTragically, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was eventually excommunicated by his colleagues for failing to accept the majority view on a matter of Jewish law.5 As for Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, he became separated from his colleagues. When they went to the academy at Yavneh, he went to Emmaus, a pleasant place to live but lacking in other Torah scholars. Eventually he forgot his learning and became a pale shadow of his former self.6 It may be that praising his students for their innate abilities rather than their effort, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai inadvertently encouraged his two most talented students to develop a fixed mindset rather than engage with colleagues and stay open to intellectual growth./\r\n\r\nPraise, and how we administer it, is a fundamental element in leadership of any kind. Recognising the good in people and saying so, we help bring people’s potential to fruition. Praising their efforts rather than their innate gifts helps encourage growth, about which Hillel used to say: “He who does not increase his knowledge, loses it” {Mishnah Avot 1:13}. The right kind of praise changes lives. That is the power of lashon hatov. Bad speech diminishes us; good speech can lift us to great heights. Or as W. H. Auden said in one of his beautiful poems:/\r\nIn the prison of his days\r\nTeach the free man how to praise.",

    vort: 'In this week\'s parsha {Leviticus 18:3}, God charges the Jewish people not to behave like the Egyptians, from whose culture we came, or the Canaanites, who inhabit the Land of Israel. What is the nature of this command? If the point is to steer us away from immoral behavior, the Torah explicitly tells us a few verses later {Leviticus 18:6-30}. What does it mean, then, that we are instructed not to act like the Egyptian or Canaanite nations?/\r\n\r\nMoreover, at the beginning of Parshat Kedoshim, the Torah states, "Be holy" {Leviticus 19:2}. Rashi interprets this statement to mean that we must separate ourselves from immorality./\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel {vol. 1} takes issue with Rashi\'s comment, and wonders: can someone who disengages from immorality really be called "holy"? Imagine a eulogizer at a funeral praising the deceased by saying, "This man was truly holy. Not once did he engage in adultery, incest, or bestiality!" Committing these sins is wickedness; refraining from them seems to be merely maintaining the status quo. How can Rashi understand the statement "Be holy" as a command to stay away from obvious misdeeds?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe begins to address our question by explaining what it means to act like an Egyptian. In his view, the Torah is not telling us to avoid performing prohibited actions; rather, it is teaching us how to engage in permitted physical activities. Even in the realm of permissible behavior, we must not overindulge or seek out passion for passion\'s sake, as the Egyptians did. Instead, we must act like Jews, striving to perform every action in a healthy, balanced way, with the ultimate goal of fulfilling God\'s will./\r\n\r\nNachmanides expresses a similar idea, as he mentions that our Sages {in Torat Kohanim} explain the statement "Be holy" as "Be separate." The Torah permits pleasurable physical activities - eating kosher meat, drinking kosher wine, intimacy between husband and wife - yet someone who is driven by lustful passions may overindulge in these activities while thinking that he is still within the bounds of Torah law. Such a person is called a "glutton" {see Proverbs 23:20}. Thus, after Parshat Acharei Mot lists all the specific prohibitions regarding immorality, Parshat Kedoshim teaches us generally, "Be holy." We must separate ourselves from overindulging in permissible activities, curbing our appetites in order to maintain dignity and holiness./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nMAKE A FENCE/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, the Tiferet Shmuel answers our question of how Rashi can imply that we are called "holy" merely by staying away from immorality. The Talmud states, "Sanctify yourself with that which is permitted to you" {Yevamot 20a}. Another passage {Avodah Zara 17a} elaborates on this idea, in which a Nazir {one who has voluntarily decided to abstain from wine} is advised not to take a shortcut through a vineyard, but rather to walk all the way around it. Strictly speaking, a Nazir may pass through a vineyard - he is only prohibited from partaking of the grapes. But since walking through a vineyard would put him in such close proximity to the prohibition, a "fence" is necessary to protect him from possible temptation. {See Avot 1:1, which states, "Make a fence for the Torah."}/\r\n\r\nIf we accustom ourselves to avoid overindulgence in that which is permissible, we surely will not engage in prohibited behavior./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tiferet Shmuel, this is what Rashi means when he interprets "Be holy" as "Be separate from immorality." The words "be separate" indicate that we should curb our appetites even in permitted areas. Then, after restating our Sages\' words, Rashi explains the reasoning behind them: "from immorality." The Tiferet Shmuel understands the word "from" to mean "because of." Due to the prohibitions against immoral behavior, we must make a fence around them to ensure that we stay far away from any wrongdoing./\r\n\r\nBased on this view, there is no contradiction between Rashi and Nachmanides; both are emphasizing the importance of maintaining holiness even in permitted activities. Furthermore, we can now understand why Rashi\'s language seemed to differ from that of our Sages. In fact, he uses the same expression {"be separate"}, but then adds a reason afterwards./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to escape from the "Egypt" within us, little by little each day, by engaging in permitted behavior in a healthy, balanced way.',

    vort: 'In this week\'s Torah portion, we find the famous imperative, "Love your fellow as yourself, I am God" {Leviticus 19:18}. Rashi {on Torat Kohanim} cites Rebbe Akiva, who said of this mitzvah, "This is a great principle in Torah" {Zeh klal gadol baTorah}. From these few words, a number of questions come to mind:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Why does the verse, "Love your neighbor as yourself" conclude with the words, "I am God"? {This question can be asked every time a verse concludes with the words, "I am God," but for now, we will focus on this verse.} The implication of this statement is, "I am God who commands you to do this mitzvah." Surely we know by now, more than halfway through the Torah, that we perform mitzvot because they are the will of God! What does this statement mean?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. What does Rebbe Akiva mean when he says, "This is a great principle in Torah"? Since when do our Sages rate the mitzvot?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Rashi, in many other places, explains that the statement, "I am God" comes to teach us that God is "ne\'eman l\'shalem s\'khar" - that He is believed to pay reward. Why does Rashi use the word "ne\'eman," which implies belief, instead of the seemingly more appropriate word "batuach" {sure}? Divinely-allotted reward and punishment is not dependent on our belief; it is guaranteed! Why not say so?/\r\n \r\n\r\nMaimonides suggests an idea that will help us resolve these difficulties. He states that two people can perform exactly the same mitzvah, yet be granted entirely different amounts of Heavenly reward. How is this fair? Maimonides explains that one person may have performed the mitzvah with great difficulty, whereas the other person may not have been challenged by it at all. A simple example is with the mitzvah of tzedaka {charity}. A rich person who gives a dollar to a needy individual is judged quite differently than a person who is struggling to get by, yet still manages to scrape together a dollar to give to charity. We are rewarded according to the level of effort we put into our performance of mitzvot and the level of difficulty this entails./\r\n\r\nNow we can answer our third question. Rashi says that God is believed to pay reward, rather than saying He is guaranteed to do so, because we must believe that God takes into consideration the effort we put into our mitzvot. Although the actions themselves do have inherent value, the level of difficulty for us in performing them leads to differing levels of spiritual reward. There is no way we could ever empirically compute this - so we must believe that God knows how to combine all the variables and reward us fairly./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nHUMBLE AND GREAT/\r\n\r\nIn order to answer our two remaining questions, we must explore the accepted concept among philosophers that love can exist between people only when they have many things in common. The Tiferet Shmuel {vol. 1} explains that, based on this idea, one might mistakenly think that it would be difficult for great leaders and scholars to love common, ordinary people. If love depends on similarity, how could a scholar who spends his days delving into the intricacies of Jewish texts possibly cultivate love for the average person? What does an accomplished scholar have in common with a ditch-digger?/\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that common ground helps people build relationships, Judaism rejects the hierarchical underpinnings of this idea. The Torah says of Moses that he was the greatest prophet who ever lived {Deut. 34:10}, and also that he was the humblest person on the face of the earth {Numbers 12:3}. These seem like contradictory statements. Didn\'t Moses realize he towered over everyone else? How could he be humble?/\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel explains that, although Moses recognized his unique capabilities, he viewed everyone within the context of their circumstances. When meeting an average person, Moses would think, "Perhaps the five minutes of Torah learning that this water carrier squeezes into the end of his exhausting day are more precious to God than all my achievements!" In this way, Moses maintained his humility./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly Maimonides’ point that we mentioned earlier - that God evaluates the effort it takes to perform a mitzvah. There is no way for us to know whose effort is worth more or less. Every learned person must try to adopt Moses\'s attitude of humility, and think, "Perhaps this simple, ordinary person is actually greater than me in God\'s eyes. Perhaps his effort is worth more."/\r\n\r\nThe Tiferet Shmuel thus understands the command, "Love your fellow as yourself," to be addressing the leaders and scholars. God tells them, "Love everyone - even average people - as yourself." If the scholar claims that such love is impossible because of the vast differences between him and the average person, God concludes the command with the words, "I am God" - in other words, "I am the one who assigns reward." Why should the scholar assume that he is on a higher level than the average person? The average person might be equal or greater because of the effort he invested!/\r\n\r\nThis answers our first question. The verse, "Love your fellow as yourself" does not conclude with the words, "I am God" in order to identify God as the source of the mitzvah. Rather, these words teach us that God can be trusted and believed to reward people according to their effort. This also answers our second question. Rebbe Akiva is not rating or ranking this mitzvah. Rather, his statement must be read as follows: Zeh klal... Gadol b\'Torah. In other words, "This principle [is intended for those who are] great in Torah"! The principle "Love your fellow as yourself" is especially relevant to those great scholars who might be tempted to think that they have little in common with the average person./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to make a shift in our thinking and approach each person we meet with the thought, "How would I fare if I were in his shoes?" May we merit to see the atmosphere of camaraderie and love that will arise from this perspective, and may we thus deserve to experience the world coming full circle and returning to its state of paradise.',

    vort: 'Shaking off layers of self-centered physicality and materialism in order to elevate our existence./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s Torah portion discusses the mitzvah of the Omer, which involves counting seven weeks from Passover until Shavuot. The Torah tells us that the Omer offering, which was brought to the Temple on the second day of Passover, must be "waved before God." This waving is clearly an integral part of the mitzvah, but it is not explained. What is the significance of waving the Omer offering? How does this mitzvah connect to the seven-week Omer period in which we currently find ourselves?/\r\n\r\nWe are taught that the Omer offering was composed of barley, which our Sages considered to be animal food. The bread offering on Shavuot, however, was composed of wheat - a more dignified grain, appropriate for human consumption. By looking at the composition of these two offerings, we can begin to understand the goal of the seven-week intermediate period between them. During this time between Passover and Shavuot, we have the opportunity to change from animals into people - to elevate our baser nature, which is driven by desires alone, and to channel its energy into the pursuit of a more meaningful, spiritually-oriented existence./\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentator Netivot Shalom, this is the purpose of waving the Omer offering. Waving represents shaking off - in this case, shaking off layers of self-centered physicality and materialism in order to elevate our existence. We see a hint to this idea in the parsha itself {Leviticus 23:9-22}, which mentions waving seven times. We could suggest that these seven mentions of waving correspond to the seven weeks between Passover and Shavuot. Each week we have the ability to shake off another layer./\r\n\r\nWhat are these layers, exactly? All the physical aspects of this world were initially created in seven days. Each week of the Omer period thus "shakes off" one of these physical layers of Creation. As we progressively refine and elevate ourselves, we prepare ourselves to receive the Torah on Shavuot./\r\n\r\n{Nachmanides actually sees the seven weeks of the Omer quite literally as seven days. He writes that the Omer period can be considered a Chol Ha\'Moed [intermediate festival period] between Passover and Shavuot. Since we start counting toward Shavuot on the second day of Passover, the holidays are fundamentally connected. Thus, instead of the usual seven-day duration of a festival, the "festival" of time from Passover until Shavuot lasts seven weeks, with each week representing a day. And, says Nachmanides, just like the Chol Ha\'Moed of Sukkot is capped by Shmini Atzeret, so too the "Chol Ha\'Moed" of Passover is capped by Shavuot, referred to by the Torah as "Atzeret."}/\r\n\r\nThe Jewish zodiac signs also illustrate the goal of progressive transformation. The Omer period always falls out during the three months of Nisan, Iyar and Sivan. The sign for Nisan is a sheep, and the sign for Iyar is an ox. These first two months are represented by animals, corresponding to our more animalistic nature at the beginning of the Omer period and the lower level of the barley offering that is brought then./\r\n\r\nThe sign for Sivan, however, is twins - people! By working on ourselves throughout the seven weeks of the Omer, we can steadily progress, week by week, until we reach the level of people who are prepared to receive the Torah./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to transform ourselves not just weekly, but also daily, as we grow towards a more meaningful, purposeful, and spiritual existence. By the time we reach Shavuot, may we stand at the peak of our potential, in the service of God.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'Why we don’t lose when performing mitzvot./\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, we find the following verse:/\r\n\r\n"If your brother becomes poor and his hand fails with you [an expression indicating poverty], you should uphold him." {Leviticus 25:35}/\r\n\r\nA number of questions confront us when reading this verse:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Why does the Torah use a double expression of poverty? Doesn\'t the first part of the verse suffice to explain the situation?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Why does the second expression of poverty {"his hand fails with you"} include the words, "with you"? These words would seem to imply that the potential giver also became impoverished, which is not true!/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. The Midrash {Vayikra Raba 34:1} states that this verse clarifies the verse in Psalms {41:2} that reads, "Fortunate is one who considers the poor person; on a bad day, God will save him." What does the Midrash mean? What is the connection between these two verses?/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. Furthermore, it would seem more sensible for the verse in Psalms to read, "Fortunate is the one who gives to the poor person." What is the benefit in merely considering the poor? What is the meaning behind the choice of words in Psalms?/\r\n \r\n\r\nWe can begin to approach these questions by examining an interesting statement about tzedakah. According to the Arizal, the act of giving tzedakah to a poor person is not only a mitzvah; it actually forms the Name of God! The coin is essentially a dot, which represents the Hebrew letter that is most dot-like: yud. The giver then takes the coin in the five fingers of his hand. The hand thus represents the Hebrew letter with the numerical value of five: hei. The giver stretches out his hand to give the coin, forming a straight line with his arm that resembles the shape of the Hebrew letter vav, whereupon the poor person opens his hand {hei} to receive the coin. In this way, God\'s Name {yud, then hei, then vav, then hei} has been spelled in order./\r\n\r\nWe can use this idea to explain the verse, "A rich man and a poor man meet; God makes them all" {Proverbs 22:2}. Although the literal interpretation of the verse is as we just stated, we could also understand it, based on the Arizal\'s idea, to mean, "A rich man and a poor man meet; all together, they make God {oseh kulam Hashem}"! [God\'s Name is spelled out in the verse]. In other words, the encounter between the giver and the recipient of tzedakah enables the two people to form the Name of God./\r\n\r\nThis is true, however, only if the giver initiates. If the poor person must request tzedakah before the giver provides it, God\'s Name is spelled out of order. In this unfortunate scenario, the poor person opens his hand {hei} and stretches out his arm {vav}, whereupon the giver reaches out his hand {hei} and gives the coin {yud}. These are still the letters of God\'s Name, but the Name is spelled backwards {hei-vav-hei-yud}./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tikkunei Zohar {10a}, it is auspicious for the letters yud and vav to come before the hei\'s in God\'s Name. {When God\'s Name is spelled in order, the letter yud comes before the first hei and the letter vav comes before the second hei.} Having the letters in this order represents mercy, life, and peace, because they spell God\'s Name in the correct order./\r\n\r\nWhen God\'s Name is in order, life flows in order. When God\'s Name is out of order, however, and the hei\'s come before the letters yud and vav, a scenario of strict justice, death, and poverty is indicated. Chaos results from God\'s Name being spelled out of order. Such a situation can come about, as we saw before, when a poor person must initiate the mitzvah of tzedakah, thus spelling God\'s Name backwards {hei-vav-hei- yud}./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nOUTSTRETCHED HAND/\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tiferet Shmuel, these ideas will help us understand the answer to the first question. The phrase, "and his hand fails with you" {u\'matah yado imach} is not repetitious. Rather, it can be translated as, "and his hand moves with you" - in other words, stretch out your hand first! The Torah is cautioning us that when a poor person stretches out his hand, he should be following our lead. We - not the poor - should initiate the mitzvah of tzedakah./\r\n\r\nThis also answers the second question, regarding the problematic words "with you." We can understand these words as an instruction, meaning, "See to it that the poor person\'s hand is with your hand, not by itself." If the poor person\'s hand is alone, it indicates that he had to reach out first, which is undesirable. If the poor person\'s hand is with your hand, however, it shows that you initiated the giving./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash we mentioned earlier picks up on these nuances, which is why it connects this verse to the verse in Psalms, "Fortunate is the one who considers {maskil} the poor." Now we can see why the verse does not define as fortunate one who merely gives to the poor, which will answer the fourth question. The word "maskil" comes from the word "sechel," meaning "intelligence." A person who gives tzedakah without intelligence, by waiting until he is asked, creates the energy of death and destruction in the world. A person who gives with intelligence, however, and is ready to reach out his hand to the poor before he is asked for assistance, creates the Name of God in the world, which brings the energy of life and health./\r\n\r\nThis answers the third question as well. The Midrash understands the intent of the verse in this week\'s portion, which is why it connects it to the verse in Psalms. Both verses refer to the same situation./\r\n\r\nHow can we learn to be proactive, and to initiate giving rather than merely responding to requests for aid? The key is to develop love for the mitzvot we\'ve been given. If we cultivate an attitude of joy and love toward mitzvot, we will be on the lookout for any opportunity to fulfill them. The Arizal, for example, attributed all the incredible greatness he achieved to the joy he put into performing mitzvot. {A story is told that, once, when the Arizal went to buy the four species before Sukkot, he was so excited that he threw his entire wallet full of money to the store owner, saying, "Take whatever you want!"}/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n \r\n\r\nENTHUSIASM ON SINAI/\r\n\r\nThis week\'s parsha gives us a hint about how to develop enthusiasm toward mitzvot. The parsha opens by describing the agricultural laws of the Sabbatical year {"shmita"}, in which the land is required to rest every seventh year. We notice one seemingly unnecessary detail before the presentation of these laws. The verse says, "God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying..." {Leviticus 25:1}./\r\n\r\nRashi asks the obvious question: wasn\'t every law given to Moses on Mount Sinai? Why are the laws of shmita specifically singled out? Rashi answers that, just as God taught Moses the general laws of shmita as well as all the intricate details relating to it, so, too, did He teach Moses the general principles and the details of all the mitzvot at Mount Sinai./\r\n\r\nBut this only answers half the question. Why was shmita, in particular, the mitzvah chosen to serve as an example? Any mitzvah could have taught us this lesson! We can resolve this problem if we examine the fundamental nature of the mitzvah of shmita./\r\n\r\nThe shmita laws are completely counter-intuitive. To farmers who rely on yearly crop yield, it would seem that keeping this mitzvah would inevitably lead to catastrophic financial loss. Yet God promises that no loss will come about through the fulfillment of the shmita laws. On the contrary; He assures us that performing this mitzvah will lead to profit and gain! This is why shmita was used as an example. It is the ultimate demonstration that we cannot lose by fulfilling mitzvot - even mitzvot that we would expect to result in severe monetary loss./\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, teaches us how to relate to all the other mitzvot that require spending money {buying the four species for Sukkot; restocking our kitchens for Passover; giving tzedakah}. We learn from the shmita laws that we will never lose by performing a mitzvah. With this knowledge, we can develop an attitude of eagerness and enthusiasm towards mitzvot - even those that require us to dig deep into our pockets./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to have such love for the performance of mitzvot, that we initiate opportunities to give a helping hand to others. And in this merit, may we be blessed with only gain in life.\r\n\r\n',

    vort: 'Parshat Bechukotai contains a series of blessings and curses. Surprisingly, only 11 verses are dedicated to blessings {Leviticus 26:3-13}, while a full 36 verses are dedicated to curses {Leviticus 26:14-46}. The contrast is striking. Why are there so many more curses than blessings? It almost seems as though someone is out to get us!/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, King David writes in Psalms, "Your staff and Your rod have comforted me" {Psalms 23:4}. It seems strange that he would use this imagery to depict comfort, since staffs and rods are instruments of pain. If King David wanted to use soothing symbolism, why didn\'t he write something like, "Pillows and cushions have comforted me"?/\r\n\r\nThe Chafetz Chaim cites the Talmud {Brachot 5a}, in which Rava explains that God smites His desired ones with pains and difficulties, as the verse says, "The one whom God desires is smitten with illness" {Isaiah 53:10}. We also find a support to this idea in the verses, "God chastises the one He loves, like a parent who desires the child" {Proverbs 3:12} and "Fortunate is the one whom God afflicts with pains and suffering" {Psalms 94:10}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nA MOTHER\'S CARE/\r\n\r\nBased on these verses, we can understand why King David used staffs and rods as examples of comfort. Staffs and rods are instruments of pain - and this is precisely the idea that King David found so comforting! The pain itself is a sign that God loves us. But how? Let us explore this idea with a concrete example./\r\n\r\nImagine you\'re walking down the street, and a few yards ahead of you, a group of children is playing ball. At a certain point, the ball is kicked into the gutter, and a 5-year-old boy runs out to retrieve it. He is so focused on the ball that he doesn\'t look for oncoming traffic, and he dashes into the street directly in front of a car. The driver notices the boy at the last second, slams on the brakes, and the car comes to a screeching halt - missing the boy by an inch./\r\n\r\nYour reaction to this scene, as a pedestrian, would most likely be to hold your breath in horror, and then, when you see that the boy is unharmed, to continue on your way, perhaps shaking your head about the impulsiveness of children./\r\n\r\nIf the boy\'s mother were witnessing the scene, on the other hand, she would react differently. Initially, she will also hold her breath in horror - but when she sees that her son is unharmed, she will run over to him, drag him off the street, and spank him soundly, all the while yelling that he should never, ever do that again!/\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the difference between you and the boy\'s mother? You don\'t care about the boy as much as his mother does. She loves him so much that she will temporarily inflict pain on him in order to teach him a lesson./\r\n\r\nLet us quickly explore five additional points that support the idea that pain indicates God\'s love for us:/\r\n\r\n1. The Ramchal {Mesillat Yesharim 1} states that challenges and difficulties remind us of the transience of this world. When, due to our pain, we realize that life is really about the next world, we can realign our values and live in accordance with what is lasting and true./\r\n2. Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch explains that pain strengthens our moral fiber and molds us. Going through difficult experiences helps us to be sensitive to others\' pain and helps us to appreciate good in our lives. Pain is therefore a gift from the One who loves us {"no pain, no gain"}, and crises and problems can be seen as opportunities for growth./\r\n3. Our pain can cause us to cry out to God, thus affording us the opportunity to develop a relationship with our Creator. This is not the same as prayer by rote; this is a much deeper level. Calling out from the depths of our heart and initiating a conversation with God in our own language is a powerful way to build a relationship with Him./\r\n4. Maimonides {Hilchot Ta\'aniyot 1:3} teaches that tragedies strike in order for us to repent and return to God./\r\n5. Pain cleanses us from any mistakes we may have made in the past./\r\n* * */\r\nCURSES AND BLESSINGS/\r\n\r\nOf course, despite all the benefits of pain, we must never ask for challenges in this area. But when troubles come on their own, ironically, our very suffering should bring us happiness and joy. The tractate of the Talmud devoted to the laws of mourning is called "Tractate of Happiness" {found at the end of Tractate Avodah Zara}. On a simple level, we can understand this as meaning that a mourner is not permitted to attend festivities and celebrations. On a deeper level, however, the title indicates that mourning is actually a happy occasion./\r\n\r\nThis explains why Parshat Bechukotai contains more curses than blessings. The curses themselves are a sign that God loves us and wants us to receive all the benefits that come from the difficulties. As the Midrash {Devarim Raba 1:4} points out, Bilam ultimately blesses the Jewish people, while Moses ultimately curses the nation. Why would our arch-enemy give us a blessing and our devoted leader give us a curse?/\r\n\r\nBilam doesn\'t want us to benefit from all the positive opportunities that come with pain. He simply wants to compliment us, to reassure us that everything is okay, so that we will not have the chance to grow beyond our current level. Moses, on the other hand, who loves us and really cares, doesn\'t let us off the hook. He chastises us harshly in order to make sure we become the best that we can be.\r\n\r\nGod loves us even more than Moses. Because of this, the curses in Parshat Bechukotai are even harsher than the curses that Moses gives in the Book of Deuteronomy {see Rashi on Leviticus 26:19 in contrast to Deut. 28:23}. We see this in the most tragic month on the Jewish calendar, as well, the month in which both Temples were destroyed and numerous other national tragedies occurred. This month is called "Av," which is the Hebrew word for "father." The calamities of Av teach us that our Creator loves us deeply. If God didn\'t care about us, He wouldn\'t bother to send us the opportunities of pain./\r\n\r\nWe can each choose whether or not to implement these ideas in our own lives in order to help us cope, change our attitudes, and better manage our own challenges. We must remember, however, never to lecture other people when they are going through a period of suffering. When others are in pain, our job is simply to be there for them, cry with them, feel their pain, and do whatever we can to provide comfort./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with the strength to face challenges and difficulties with a healthy frame of mind, so that we clarify the purpose of life, stretch ourselves to the maximum, and become as close as possible to God, Who is loving us every moment.',

    vort: 'Hard work, happiness and humility are the keys to success in Torah learning./\r\n\r\nThis week\'s parsha is always read before Shavuot, the festival of receiving the Torah. What is the connection is between the two? How does Parshat Bamidbar prepare us for the festival of Shavuot?/\r\n\r\nThe first verse in this week\'s portion tells us that God spoke to Moses in the Sinai desert {Numbers 1:1}. The Midrash {Bamidbar Rabba 1:7} questions why it is necessary for the Torah to specify the location in which God spoke to Moses. According to the Midrash, our Sages derive from this detail that three elements were present when the Torah was given: fire, water and desert./\r\n\r\nWe learn about fire from the verse, "All of Mount Sinai was smoking because God descended upon it in fire" {Exodus 19:18}. Water is specified in the verse, "The heavens dripped with water" {Judges 5:4}, which describes the giving of the Torah. Finally, we learn about the desert from the phrase "in the Sinai desert" in this week\'s portion. What message is the Torah trying to convey by listing the weather conditions at the time we received the Torah?!/\r\n\r\nThere are three primary keys to success in Torah learning:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Hard work and intense involvement in study./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Happiness and joy while studying.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Humility coming from the knowledge that, ultimately, our achievements in learning are not a result of our own efforts, but due to the kindness of God who gives us Torah./\r\n \r\n\r\nWe see a hint to these three attributes in the Talmudic opinions regarding the blessings one must recite before studying Torah {Brachot 11b}. The Talmud lists three opinions:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Rav Yehuda, in the name of Shmuel, claims that one must recite the blessing, "...who has commanded us to be involved in the study of Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Rebbe Yochanan claims that we should say instead, "May You make the words of Torah be sweet in our mouths."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Rav Ham\'nuna claims that we should say, "Blessed are You, the One Who gives Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Talmud concludes that we should follow all of these opinions, and recite all three blessings before beginning Torah study./\r\n\r\nMaking a blessing over a mitzvah prepares us to fulfill the mitzvah. Thus, making a blessing before we begin to study Torah prepares us for the mitzvah of learning Torah. Once we understand this, we can see that these three blessings mentioned in the Talmud correlate exactly to the three keys for successful Torah learning that we listed initially:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "to be involved in the study of Torah" corresponds to the hard work that is necessary to invest in studying./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "make the words of Torah sweet in our mouths" corresponds to the happiness and joy we must feel when engaged in study./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe blessing, "the One Who gives Torah" corresponds to the humility that results when we realize that our achievements are not due to our own effort, but are actually a result of Divine benevolence./\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nKEYS TO SUCCESS/\r\n\r\nBased on the Shem MiShmuel, we can now understand the deeper message of the Midrash in listing the three elements that were present at the giving of the Torah:/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFire symbolizes hard work. We see this explicitly in the Yiddish word "farbrent" {literally, "on fire"}, which is used to describe intense effort in Torah learning. As we mentioned above, the idea of hard work corresponds to the blessing, "to be involved in the study of Torah."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWater symbolizes happiness. In the Land of Israel, rain is considered a blessing and a benefit. We should all be happy when it rains, since almost every aspect of our lives depends on water. This idea corresponds to the blessing, "make the words of Torah sweet in our mouths."/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe desert represents humility. It is low and flat, and people walk all over it. This corresponds to the blessing, "the One Who gives Torah" - since, as we mentioned, it takes humility to recognize that our own efforts are not the ultimate cause of our success./\r\n \r\n\r\nNow we can finally understand why Parshat Bamidbar is read right before Shavuot. On Shavuot, we do not simply commemorate the original acceptance of Torah, but we accept the Torah upon ourselves anew. In order to prepare ourselves to truly receive Torah on this day, Parshat Bamidbar gives us the keys that will enable our Torah learning to succeed./\r\n\r\nMay we all be triply blessed: to work hard in learning the Torah that was given at Mount Sinai in fire, with sweet happiness that feels as good as cool water, so that this Shavuot will be a humble, down-to-earth acceptance of God\'s extraordinary gift.',

    vort: 'One of the highlights of Parshat Naso is the Priestly Blessing. The text of this blessing, which the Kohanim bestow upon the Jewish people, concludes, "May God turn His face to you and give you peace" {Numbers 6:26}./\r\n\r\nOur Sages speak very highly of the quality of peace. For example, we find the statement in the Midrash {Bamidbar Raba 11:7} in the name of R\' Shimon bar Chalafta, "Great is peace, for there is no vessel that can receive blessing other than peace." The Midrash brings a proof to this idea from the verse {Psalms 29:11}, "God will bless His nation with peace."/\r\n\r\nWe can understand this idea more deeply by taking a closer look at the phrase, "His nation." The Jewish people are composed of three categories of people: Priests {Kohanim}, Levites {Leviim}, and Israelites {Yisraelim}. The Hebrew acronym of the words "Kohanim," "Leviim," and "Yisraelim" spells the word kli, which means "vessel." Once we understand that the Jewish people themselves are a vessel, we can gain a more profound insight into the Midrash\'s statement. The vessel of the Jewish people can receive blessing only when there is peace!/\r\n\r\nWe can offer four primary pieces of advice for how to achieve peace with others:/\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that all our efforts are for God\'s sake. If we do everything for the honor of God, and not for the sake of boosting our own ego, we can view one another as part of the same team, pooling all of our different strengths and talents for a common goal./\r\n2. Train ourselves to see only the good in others. Instead of being threatened or challenged by others\' differences, view the differences as positive qualities./\r\n3. The Peleh Yoetz suggests that we should focus on the reward we receive for making peace, as an incentive to pursue it. He gives a striking example. Imagine a person approaches you and asks you to make peace with someone you can\'t stand. Your initial reaction is to immediately turn down the offer. Then the person asks, "What if I give you $50? Do you think you could try? How about $100? Or $1,000? If I give you $100,000, could you do it? How about two million dollars?" There is a point at which every person would give in and decide it was worth the effort to make peace.\r\nAccording to the Peleh Yoetz, the reward we get in the World to Come for making peace far outweighs any financial bonus this world can offer. This knowledge should be an incentive to us to make peace./\r\n\r\n4. Making peace sometimes requires us to compromise or to give in. We can do this only if we cultivate our humility and learn to be satisfied with the minimum./\r\n* * */\r\nTHREE LEVITE FAMILIES/\r\n\r\nAlthough these four points are important, we can also suggest another approach in understanding God\'s expectation of us when it comes to peace. The beginning of this week\'s Torah portion focuses on the tribe of Levi, which is composed of three main families: Kehat, Gershon, and Merari. Based on the Shem MiShmuel and the Netivot Shalom, we can understand these three families as representing three spiritual levels./\r\n\r\nThe family of Kehat represents the highest, most righteous level. Their role is to carry the Holy Ark {Rashi on Numbers 4:4} - the highest component of the Tabernacle. The importance of this task underscores their lofty spiritual level./\r\n\r\nThe family of Gershon represents the middle level. They carry the curtain that divides the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Sanctuary {Numbers 4:25}. One side of the curtain is close to the intense sanctity of the Holy of Holies, while the other side is not. We could suggest that this curtain hints to the spiritual level of an average person, who fluctuates between moments of intense devotion and moments of feeling less connected to the Divine./\r\n\r\nThe family of Merari represents the lowest level. They carry the beams and pillars of the Sanctuary {Numbers 4:31}, the weight of which can be burdensome. This physical weight represents the heaviness of the lowest spiritual level./\r\n\r\nThe tribe of Levi is charged with teaching the Jewish people how to attach themselves to the Divine {see Rambam, "Shmita V\'Yovel," 13:12-13}. The three main families in this tribe show us that we are required to serve God not only when we are on a spiritual high, like the most righteous people, and not only when we feel average, but even when we feel the lowest and furthest away from God. Regardless of the emotional state in which we find ourselves, we must commit ourselves to doing God\'s will with a positive attitude./\r\n\r\nThis idea will offer us a new perspective on God\'s expectation of peace. In addition to being at peace with others, we must learn to be at peace with ourselves - whatever level we are functioning on. When we are frustrated with ourselves, it is much more likely that we will lash out at others. Being at peace with ourselves, however, usually leads to our being at peace with others. If we can learn from the tribe of Levi how to maintain our inner equilibrium, we have a much better chance at establishing peace with others as well./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed to cultivate within ourselves the four primary qualities that lead to peace: acting only for God\'s sake; seeing the good in others; focusing on the rewards earned through this behavior; and being humble and satisfied with the minimum, which will enable us to compromise. Most important, may we learn to be at peace with ourselves. May we recognize the worth of our service, even at its lowest point, and realize that, even then, we have the potential to function at the highest level.',

    vort: "In this week's parsha, we find one of the most perplexing passages in the Torah. The Jewish people in the desert are suddenly overwhelmed by a craving for meat {Numbers 11:4}. God is \"angered\" by the people's desire, but nevertheless promises to provide an abundance of meat for them - an entire month's worth, \"until it comes out of your noses\" {Numbers 11:20}./\r\n\r\nAt this point, Moses asks God a series of seemingly outrageous questions: \"I am living amidst 600,000 people who are traveling by foot, and You say You will supply a month's worth of meat for them? Can enough sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them? Would all the fish of the sea be enough for them?\" God responds to Moses's questions, \"Is My Hand short? Now you will see whether I am good for My word or not\" {Numbers 11:21-23}./\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how Moses, who had the closest possible relationship with the Divine, could have explicitly doubted God's ability to provide. If God created the entire world ex nihilo, why should it be difficult for Him to provide sufficient meat for the Jewish people? Although many commentators grapple with this issue, we will present the opinion of the Da'at Zekainim {Numbers 11:23}./\r\n\r\nThe generation of the desert had a unique law that prohibited the slaughter of meat solely for personal consumption. Therefore, a person who wanted to eat meat was obligated to bring an offering to the Tabernacle. He would slaughter an animal, place a portion of the meat on the altar, and give a portion to the Kohanim. Only the remaining third of the meat belonged to the owner who had brought the offering./\r\n\r\nThe Priests were required to finish their portion of meat before dawn of the following day. Any meat that was leftover at daybreak became invalid and had to be burned - an act that ideally was to be avoided. Therefore, the Priests made every effort to consume the meat within the appointed time./\r\n\r\nBased on these laws, the Da'at Zekeinim explain Moses’s words in the following way. God said that He would provide the people with a month's worth of meat in one day. Moses is certain that God can fulfill His word - but imagine hundreds and thousands of people suddenly converging at once on the Tabernacle with their animals! There were only three Kohanim {Aaron and his two sons} to serve the entire Jewish people. How would it be possible for them to eat such a vast quantity of sacrificial meat before dawn?/\r\n\r\nFurther, according to the Da'at Zekeinim, Moses’s question, \"Can You provide enough fish for them?\" {Numbers 11:22} is to be read as a statement. Moses was implying, \"If You had promised to provide fish for them, they would be able to eat whatever they wanted, since we don't bring offerings from fish. But because You said, 'I will provide meat for them,' they will need to bring a sacrifice! How can You expect Aaron and his sons to eat so much meat within the allotted time?\"/\r\n\r\nGod responds, \"Is My Hand short?\" When God said He would provide meat, He meant quail: a type of bird from which no offering is brought! Therefore, this would circumvent any possibility of leftover meat./\r\n\r\nFowl is considered to have the halachic status of meat, but the origins of this categorization are debatable. Was this law derived directly from the Torah, or did it result from a later decision of the Sages? From this passage we see that when God said \"meat,\" He was referring to quail. According to the opinion of the Da'at Zekeinim, we could therefore suggest that fowl's status as meat is given directly by the Torah./\r\n\r\n[This is the view held by Tosefot {Chullin 104b}. For further analysis, see Maimonides {Mamrim 2:9}, Yorah Deah 87:3 and Shach 4.]/\r\n\r\nThe Da'at Zekeinim, by understanding the dialogue this way, justify Moses's surprising words. Moses never doubted God's ability to provide. If anything, the limitation was with the people./\r\n\r\nAs we sit down at our dinner table, may we enjoy some delicious meat and some meaty words of Torah, and in this way have a full and complete experience./\r\n\r\n",

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha deals with the story of the spies who scouted out the Land of Israel and returned with a negative report. Their unfavorable portrayal of the land caused the entire Jewish people to despair of the possibility of living there and to voice their desire to return to Egypt. God was "angry" at the spies for speaking negatively about the land, and decreed that the entire generation "will die in the desert" {Numbers 14:35}./\r\n\r\nApparently, God never forgave the Jewish people for this sin. Even to this day, we bear the consequences for the spies\' evil report. The verse, "The people wept that night" {Numbers 14:1} refers to the night of Tisha B\'Av. The Talmud {Taanit 29a} teaches that as punishment for the people\'s weeping needlessly over the spies\' report, God caused many tragedies to happen on Tisha B\'Av so that, throughout the generations, we would have "good reason to cry."/\r\n\r\nThe severity of this punishment is very unusual. The Jewish people have made many errors and misjudgments over the course of history, yet rarely have the consequences been so severe. Why was the mistake of the spies so unforgivable?/\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses reminds the Jewish people of their complaints in the desert: "You spoke slander in your tents, saying, \'It is because God hates us that He took us out of the land of Egypt" {Deut. 1:27}. Rashi uses a comparison to explain how the Jewish people came to that conclusion. Imagine a king who had two sons and two fields. One field was self-irrigated {shakya}, while the other relied on rain for irrigation {ba\'al}. The king gave the self-irrigated field to the son he loved, so the son would never have to worry about his crops, while he gave the field dependent on rainwater to the son he hated./\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people saw that God had taken them out of Egypt - a lush, fertile land, where the Nile River provided a constant source of irrigation - and was taking them to the Land of Israel, which depended on rainfall. They thus concluded that God must hate them. Based on Rashi\'s parable, this seems like a logical inference. The Torah does not directly address the people\'s assumption, and the question is left hanging. How is the journey from Egypt to the Land of Israel to be seen as anything other than a punishment?/\r\n\r\nIf we view the Land of Israel only in terms of the physical and material benefits it provides, then there may certainly be more comfortable places to live. However, if we look beyond the superficial qualities of Israel, and use our inner vision to perceive its spiritual advantages, then it is far better to live in Israel and depend on rainfall than it is to live in Egypt with no worries about water. Why? The very fact of our dependence on rain forces us to develop ourselves spiritually. If there is no rain, we must pray, and turning heavenward compels us to recognize the true Source of sustenance./\r\n\r\nThis could be one reason that a field that relies on rainwater is called a ba\'al. The word ba\'al literally means "owner" or "master." Living in the Land of Israel constantly reminds us that the world has a ba\'al, and our reliance on Him keeps our relationship strong./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * */\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR IN ISRAEL/\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can understand why the Jewish people were never forgiven for the sin of the spies. According to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spector, the punishment we received teaches us how stringently God views a negative attitude toward the Land of Israel. If we cut ourselves off from the Land of Israel, we cut ourselves off from the extraordinary spiritual advantages that the land has to offer and all the opportunities for growth that it provides. Severing ourselves from this potential defeats the entire purpose of our existence./\r\n\r\nEvery year at this time, students who have spent the year studying in Israel go back to the Diaspora to spend the summer with their families. For many, their first Shabbat abroad is parshat Shlach. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the timing works out this way. When everyone gathers together around the Shabbat table and the family begins asking, "How was your year in Israel?", these students literally have the opportunity to rectify the sin of the spies./\r\n\r\nMost of the spies saw only the physical, external aspects of the Land, and many things seemed strange to them. Because they saw only these superficial elements, and failed to see the land\'s inner spiritual beauty, they concluded that Israel was a bad and dangerous place to live. Visitors to Israel today are the "spies" of this generation. They have the choice of joining forces with the ten spies who viewed the land negatively, or siding with Yehoshua and Calev, who had deeper, inner vision and perceived the land\'s spiritual richness. Before we open our mouths to share our experiences in the Land of Israel with our family and friends, let us pause for a moment and think about what we are about to say./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to visit and live in Israel, so that we can focus wisely and deeply on what is truly important in life, and pursue it with a fire that will elevate us to the highest levels.',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha tells the story of a man named Korach who led a mutinous rebellion against Moses and Aaron. Korach claimed that the entire Jewish people was holy, and therefore it was inappropriate for Moses and Aaron to exalt themselves over the people {Numbers 16:3}. Moses responds to Korach, "In the morning, God will make known who is His own and who is the holy one, and He will draw him close to Him" {Numbers 16:5}./\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that Moses would want to wait until the morning to resolve such a critical issue. Why not settle the matter immediately?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Rashi {based on Midrash Tanchuma 7} teaches that Korach spent the entire night going around to each tribe and trying to gain support for his rebellion. Why does the Midrash stress that Korach went around at night?/\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, certain actions that are not explicitly condemned in the Torah are nevertheless considered more severe than sins that are explicitly mentioned. Korach, by arguing against his rabbi, provides one example of this principle. The Talmud {Sanhedrin 110a} teaches that one who disagrees with, argues with, complains against, or suspects his rabbi is considered to be exhibiting all these behaviors toward God Himself./\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the Talmud can equate a rabbi with the Divine - a comparison that seems to border on idolatry! - we must examine another Talmudic passage {Ketubot 111b}. Several verses in the Torah {Deut. 4:4, Deut. 30:20} instruct us to cleave to God. The Talmud wonders how this is possible, since God is described as an all-consuming fire {Deut. 4:24}. How can we be expected to attach ourselves to a blaze of perfect holiness?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud answers by explaining that anyone who marries his daughter to a Sage, does business with a Sage, or uses his property to give pleasure to a Sage {for example, providing him with a meal} is considered as if he attached himself to the Divine Presence./\r\n\r\nAccording to the Netivot Shalom, the purpose of the Torah and all its mitzvot is to enable us to cleave to God {d\'veikut}. One mitzvah in particular, however, helps us achieve this goal more than all the others: cleaving to Torah scholars. When the Talmud compares a rabbi to God, it does not mean that the rabbi is God, God forbid. Rather, our connection and attachment to a rabbi brings us to a deeper connection to God. From observing how our Sages behave, even in the most mundane areas {eating, speaking, walking, conducting business}, we learn how to become God-like in every facet of life. In this way, we become closer to God./\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we can see the severity of Korach\'s error. When Korach stated, "The entire congregation is holy," {Numbers 16:3}, he was implying that the Jewish people no longer needed to have a rabbi. It seems that Korach wanted to prevent the Jewish people from cleaving to Torah scholars, thereby preventing them from cleaving to God. According to this understanding, Korach was rebelling not only against Moses and Aaron, but against the very purpose of Torah and mitzvot./\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the letters of Korach\'s name provide a hint to this idea, since they form the acronym of the phrase Chalak Kedushat Rabo {"He argued on the sanctity of his rabbi"}./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSUN AND MOON/\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand why Moses waited until the morning to resolve the dispute with Korach, whereas Korach acted at night. The Midrash {Shmot Raba 15} teaches that the Jewish people are compared to the moon. We can understand this statement based on the Talmud\'s {Chullin 60b} explanation of an apparent contradiction in the Torah, which states, "God made the two great luminaries, the great luminary to serve by day and the small luminary to serve by night" {Genesis 1:16}. How can two "great" luminaries be different sizes?/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud explains that originally the sun and the moon were both the same size. However, the moon complained to God, "Can two kings share the same crown?" God acknowledged the moon\'s objection, saying "Go and diminish yourself."/\r\n\r\nMaimonides {Laws of Kiddush HaChodesh} states that the moon does not generate its own light, but is rather a reflection of the sun\'s light. According to the Toldot Yaakov Yosef, the moon initially complained to God because it thought it did generate its own light. God\'s response {"Go and diminish yourself"} was intended to teach the moon the true nature of its illumination. It is as if He told the moon, "You think you provide your own light because you are so close to the sun. Once you create some distance {"go"}, you will see on your own {"yourself"} that you are small."/\r\n\r\n[This is not the straightforward understanding of the Talmud, in which God literally made the moon smaller. According to this new approach, the first half of the verse, which refers to the two great luminaries, describes how the luminaries appeared. The second half of the verse clarifies what was actually there. God never created two equal "kings" in the first place.]/\r\n\r\nNow we can see why the Jewish people are compared to the moon. The moon does not generate its own light and needs the light of the sun in order to shine. The masses of the Jewish people also do not start out with their own light; we need a rabbi, who is compared to the sun, to give us light and help us shine. A rabbi has his own light because he has already achieved d\'veikut with God, whereas the majority of us are still working toward that goal./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nEVIDENT AT NIGHT/\r\n\r\nThe Tifferet Shmuel {vol. 2} points out that the moon\'s mistake occurred at night. When the moon was directly opposite the sun, shining brightly, it assumed it generated its own light. In the daytime, however, when there is a greater distance between the sun and the moon, it became obvious that the moon never generated its own light at all./\r\n\r\nThis is why the Midrash stresses that Korach tried to gain support for his rebellion at night. Korach lived in darkness. Although he was a Torah scholar, he got so close to Moses, his rabbi, that he began to think he had his own light. Therefore, he tried to gain followers at night, because he shone most brightly at that time. Moses, on the other hand, knew the true source of Korach\'s light. This is why he waited until the morning to resolve the issue. In the daytime, it would be obvious that Korach was merely a reflection of Moses\'s light. Perhaps he would realize on his own that he still needed a rabbi./\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the remedy for Korach\'s error can also be found in the letters of his name. The letters of korach can be rearranged to spell the word rachok {"distant"}. In the daytime, when the sun and the moon are farther apart, Korach could see with clarity what was not evident at night. The letters of korach also spell the word kerach {"ice"}. With the clarity of distance, Korach could have seen that he was as cold as ice without Moses, and that he did not have his own fire at all./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to find and follow a real rabbi who speaks to us and whose light will cause us to shine. In this way, may we grow ever closer to God, becoming more and more God-like, so that we may be elevated to the highest levels.\r\n',

    vort: "Among the many topics discussed in Parshat Chukat, we find the story of the Jewish people's complaints about the \"destructive bread\" {the manna}. God was displeased with the people's complaints, and responded by sending a plague of poisonous snakes to bite the Jewish people, causing numerous deaths./\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe shares an insight into the crime of the Jewish people. According to his approach, the people resented the way God was guiding the world. Although the people realized that God was in the driver's seat, they were not happy with where He was taking them./\r\n\r\nWe learn in the Talmud {Avot 4:1} that a truly wealthy person is one who is happy with his portion. The Slonimer Rebbe interprets this to mean that a wealthy person is one who is happy with the unique set of circumstances that God has allotted to him. We find a proof to this in another place {Avot 5:3}, which says that Abraham passed all 10 tests he was given./\r\n\r\nThis statement makes sense in reference to some of the tests - for example, the command to circumcise himself at an advanced age. In order to pass this test, Abraham had to take action - to take a knife to his own flesh. However, other tests did not require action. We might wonder, for example, how Abraham passed the test of \"learning that his descendents would have to suffer through years of exile.\" Although Abraham was privy to future information in this instance, there was nothing that he could do!/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe claims that Abraham passed these types of tests by accepting God's decisions with love. This teaches us a potent lesson. We are often pained when bitter changes occur in our lives. Obviously, the first course of action is to try to change the difficult situation. However, if we see that a particular situation is temporarily or permanently unchangeable, our test is to change ourselves to meet the challenge. In other words, we need to learn how to live with unchangeable circumstances so that we change and mature. Although the situation may be inflexible, we can change ourselves to become more sensitive, tolerant and patient people. This is how Abraham responded to his unchangeable circumstances./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nSPIRITUAL FOOD/\r\n\r\nThis idea applies to our parsha, as well. It seems strange that the Jewish people would begin complaining about the manna at the end of their 40 years in the wilderness. They had been eating it for this entire period of time! Couldn't they hold out just a little longer? The manna would finish in another 36 days, upon the Jewish people's entry into the Land of Israel!/\r\n\r\nWe can understand a novel insight into the Jewish people's complaint based on the teachings of the Megala Amukos. According to this view, the Jews were not complaining about the manna. Rather, at the end of 40 years, they saw that there was going to be a change from spiritual food {manna} to physical food. Entry into the Land of Israel would require them to begin cultivating and eating regular food. Unlike the manna, this physical food would not be completely absorbed by their bodies - and it is this physical food that the Jews called \"destructive bread,\" because they were dismayed at the prospect of once again excreting waste! How, they asked themselves, would they be able to maintain high spiritual levels while eating physical food? It is so much easier to maintain lofty spiritual heights when eating spiritual food!/\r\n\r\nInstead of being happy with God's decision, they complained. Instead of focusing inward to bring out their potential of changing themselves to meet this external change, they were simply disappointed with God's conduct./\r\n\r\nMay we learn to be happy with what we have, avoiding panic, frustration and complaint, in order to pass our 10 tests of life when the circumstances are unchangeable.\r\n",

    vort: "Parshat Balak tells the story of a Moabite king named Balak who is terrified by the Jewish people's presence on the border of his country. Since the Jews were recently victorious over the mighty armies of Sichon and Og {see Numbers 21:31-35}, Balak knows that he will be unable to defeat them militarily. Instead, he tries a different approach: he hires a gentile prophet, Bilam, whom he instructs to curse the Jewish people and thereby destroy them {Numbers 22:5-6}. {Balak's behavior has contemporary overtones. Today we see many examples of those who try to destroy Israel politically when they recognize that they will be unable to do so by force.}/\r\n\r\nThe Zohar {3:210a} makes a statement that leads us to examine this story more carefully: Balak was a great sorcerer! If so, why did he need to hire Bilam to destroy the Jewish people? Why couldn't Balak simply have done the job himself?/\r\n\r\nWe can explain this based on the Yesod V'Shoresh HaAvodah {2:3:12, citing Maimonides' \"Moreh Nevuchim\"}, which states that when a Jew is attached to the Divine, he is protected from all negativity and strict judgments. According to this view, bad things happen to righteous people only in moments of interruption and distraction. This breaks their focus and severs their attachment to God, which creates an opening for negativity to enter./\r\n\r\nThe Netivot Shalom uses this idea to explain the mechanics of blessings and curses. A blessing creates connection and attachment to God, whereas a curse creates separation and distance from God. Bilam's power to curse therefore indicated his goal: to separate the Jewish people from their closeness to the Divine./\r\n\r\nNow we can understand why Balak needed Bilam's help in destroying the Jews. As long as the Jewish people were attached to the Divine, they were immune from all negative forces. Even the most powerful sorcery and magic in the world could have no effect on them. Balak therefore wanted Bilam to curse the Jews in order to break their strong connection to God. If this connection could be broken, then Balak's evil sorcery would be able to penetrate and the Jews would be destroyed./\r\n\r\n* * */\r\nTRANSFORMING THE CURSE/\r\n\r\nAs the parsha continues, however, we see that Bilam is unable to curse the Jews, despite his repeated efforts to do so. In fact, every time Bilam tries to curse the Jewish people, God forces him to utter words of blessing instead! The Talmud {Sanhedrin 105b} comments on this, saying, \"From the blessings of that wicked man, you learn what was in his heart.\" Apparently, Bilam's true intentions were not completely disguised by the blessings he was forced to speak. How can we deduce Bilam's original intent?/\r\n\r\nThe verse tells us, \"God, your God ... transformed the curses into blessing, because God, your God, loves you\" {Deut. 23:6}. Blessings are the opposite of curses. Therefore, we should be able to deduce Bilam's true intentions by simply reading the opposite of what he said! For example, Bilam says, \"He did not see any sin in Yaakov or any crookedness in Yisrael. The Lord his God is with him, and the King's friendship is within him\" {Numbers 23:21}. This blessing, like many of Bilam's blessings, implies a very close relationship to the Divine - a connection of warmth and attachment. From here we can deduce that Bilam would have preferred to curse us with utter separation and detachment from God./\r\n\r\nBefore Bilam utters his final blessing, the Torah tells us that he \"saw the Jewish people dwelling together in their tribes\" {Numbers 24:2}. This paints a picture of a nation that lives in harmonious, tight-knit communities. According to the Netivot Shalom, such a feeling of closeness and attachment stems from love - since, when we love someone, we want to be with them all the time. This teaches us an important lesson. In order to achieve a level of close relationship with God, we must first cultivate it among ourselves. Our efforts to develop deep connections with other people are an exercise to help us ultimately develop a deep connection with God./\r\n\r\nWe see a proof to this idea in the famous verse, \"Love your fellow as yourself, I am God\" {Leviticus 19:18}. Why does God need to identify Himself at the end of this verse? Don't we know by now that God, the source of all the Torah's commandments, is the source of this commandment as well? The Netivot Shalom explains that the verse is not intended to teach us the source of the mitzvah; rather, it is teaching us the progression of our relationships. Only after we develop the ability to love other people as ourselves can we know how to experience closeness with the Divine./\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nONE PLUS LOVE/\r\n\r\nWe see a hint to this idea in the Hebrew word echad {literally, \"one\"}, which symbolizes unity, oneness, attachment. The numerical value of the word echad is 13, and the value of ahava {love} is also 13. If we add echad to ahava, the result is 26: the same numerical value as the four-letter Name of God. We can learn from here that when one person attaches to another person with closeness and love, it ultimately leads to the same relationship with God./\r\n\r\nA practical way of creating closeness and love in our own lives is to bless each other. By giving blessings, we can create an environment of love, acceptance, and connection. This brings us closer together, leading to the possibility of achieving closeness with God as well. If, however, we curse each other instead {God forbid}, we create division and disunity among ourselves, which cuts us off from God, leaving us unprotected from negativity./\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the scenario that Balak hoped for when he hired Bilam to curse us. He did not want Bilam's curse to stand alone. Rather, Balak hoped that Bilam would incite us to curse each other, thereby driving a wedge between the Jewish people and God and making us susceptible to all the negative energies of the world./\r\n\r\nMay we never forget what happened in the times of Balak and Bilam. May we learn that the only way to protect ourselves from negative energy is by attaching ourselves to God, and that we can achieve closeness with God only by bringing ourselves closer to each other. May we learn that blessing each other creates a powerful force of unity, and may our blessings constantly pour forth and flow among us lovingly, protecting us from any calamity.\r\n",

    vort: "Bridging the gap between mind and heart.//\r\n\r\nThis parsha tells of the war waged by the Jews against the nation of Midian, in retaliation for the Midianite women's enticement of the Jewish men. Moses {Numbers 31:3} charges the people to prepare \"anashim\" {men} to wage this war, which Rashi understands as meaning \"righteous people.\" According to the Midrash {Shir HaShirim Raba 4:3}, these people were righteous because they never donned the tefillin of the head before donning the tefillin on the arm. Had they had done so, Moses would not have praised them as righteous people and they would not have been victorious in war./\r\n\r\nThis seems strange, for two reasons. First of all, Jewish law requires that a person don the box of tefillin on the arm before donning the box on the head. Why, then, is doing so considered a righteous quality that renders a person fitting for war? Furthermore, the Torah does not mention the proper donning of tefillin as a requirement for any previous war. Why is it specifically mentioned in regard to the war against Midian?/\r\n\r\nThe Slonimer Rebbe {Netivot Shalom} addresses these questions with a striking statement: \"Judaism is dependent upon the lesson gleaned from the commandment of tefillin.\" This lesson is that a Jew must dedicate both his heart and his mind to the service of God. {It should be noted that a person can benefit from the message of tefillin even without wearing it.} Let us take a closer look at the essence of the heart and the mind in order to further understand this lesson of tefillin./\r\n\r\nThe heart is the source of our passions and desires, whereas the mind is the source of our outlooks and intellectual views. Human nature tempts us to give free reign to our passions and then to create intellectual justifications for succumbing to them. This is precisely why Jewish law requires us to don the arm tefillin before the head tefillin. The box on the arm, which lies opposite the heart, teaches us to channel our passions to God. Only then can we dedicate our intellectual energies to the Divine and trust that our philosophies are not distortions of reality./\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the Torah refers to tefillin as an \"ot\" {\"sign\"} {Exodus 13:9}. The sign of a true Jew lies in his mastering the art of channeling his heart's desires to God, therefore enabling him to trust that his intellectual reasoning is correct and true./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *//\r\n \r\n\r\nMIDIANITE WOMEN/\r\n\r\nThis idea helps us understand why men who donned tefillin properly were the soldiers in the war against Midian. In order to defeat Midian, the Jews needed to counteract the scheme of the gentile prophet Bilam, who arranged the downfall of the Jewish people. Bilam encouraged the daughters of Midian to become prostitutes in order to entice the Jewish men to acts of immorality. Bilam knew that God would be unable to tolerate such behavior {see Sanhedrin 106a, based on Numbers 24:14} and would swiftly destroy the perpetrators of the immoral acts./\r\n\r\nFrom here we see that Bilam understood how to use the lesson of tefillin in a destructive way. He first planned to corrupt the hearts of the Jewish people, because he knew that, once their hearts were swayed, their minds would follow./\r\n\r\nThis idea is borne out in the order in which the Torah discusses the event. First, the passions of the heart are mentioned - \"The Jews began to commit immoral acts with the [Midianite] daughters\" {Numbers 25:1} - and then, several verses later, we see the subsequent impurity of the mind, when the people began worshipping idols {Numbers 25:3}. The people's idol worship provided an intellectual justification for their immoral actions - since, according to the idolatrous Midianite philosophy, all behavior is acceptable. The sin of the Jewish men with the Midianite women demonstrates that, once we have a desire in our heart, our minds can fabricate any justification to carry out that desire./\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the Jewish retaliation against Midian required that the people use the lesson of tefillin in a positive way. This was accomplished by selecting soldiers who donned the arm tefillin prior to the head tefillin. The box on the arm, which channels the heart's desires to the Divine, prevents immorality, while the box on the head, which channels the mind's philosophies to the Divine, prevents idolatry. Therefore, we can understand that the men who went to war were not righteous simply because they fulfilled the technicality of tefillin; rather, they embodied its powerful message! They first directed the heart's passions to God in order to then successfully channel the mind's philosophies to God as well./\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* * *///\r\n \r\n\r\nBELIEF IN GOD/\r\n\r\nRabbi Elchanan Wasserman {in Kovetz Ma'amarim} uses this idea to explain why even some of the world's greatest thinkers and philosophers have been unable to acknowledge the existence of God. In his view, the existence of an Ultimate Creator is simple and obvious. Just as a home testifies to a builder, so does the world, which is far more complex and sophisticated, testify to a Creator. Nevertheless, many great minds have not recognized this self-evident argument, for the simple reason that accepting it would require them to change their lifestyle. Belief in a sophisticated God, who imposes guidelines for proper conduct, prevents people from living according to their desires. Therefore, in order to carry out the heart's desires, people can conjure up outrageous philosophies to justify that lifestyle./\r\n\r\nThis idea also enables us to understand the Torah's command to believe in God {Maimonides, Sefer Mitzvot, positive #1, based on Exodus 20:2}. How could the Torah possibly command an unbelieving person to believe in a Creator? It is simply not within that person's power! The answer, according to Rabbi Wasserman, is that the command is not intended to force a person to have belief. Rather, we are commanded to remove the obstacles that prevent us from believing in God - which is to say, the unbridled passions of the heart. Once we remove these blockages, belief in God is a natural result./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to become real Jewish soldiers, by channeling first our heart's passions and then our mind's outlooks, so that we can stand as a sign for the rest of the world that there is only one God who created the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha, Masei, describes the journeys of the Jewish people during their 40 years in the desert. These wanderings from place to place are as a lesson about the transience and temporality of life in this world. According to the Degel Machaneh Ephraim {based on the Baal Shem Tov}, the 42 places that the Jews encamped in the desert represent the 42 phases within each person\'s life./  This idea seems to follow the statement of the Nachmanides {Genesis 12:6, citing Tanchuma 9} that "the actions of the forefathers are repeated by their descendants." In other words, just as the Jewish people in the desert were transient wanderers, constantly moving from place to place, so, too, is our existence in this world temporary./  A hint to this idea is found in this week\'s parsha, yet in order to understand it, we must first go back to the beginning of Creation. The second verse of the Torah {Genesis 1:2} reads, "And the earth was EMPTINESS and VOID, and DARKNESS was on the face of the DEPTHS, and THE SPIRIT OF God hovered over the face of the waters."/  The Midrash {Bereishis Raba 2:4, in the name of Reish Lakish} interprets this verse as a prophecy about the future exiles of the Jewish people. EMPTINESS symbolizes the Babylonian exile; VOID refers to the Persian-Medean exile; DARKNESS represents the Syrian-Greek exile; and the DEPTHS refers to the current Roman exile. THE SPIRIT OF God alludes to the spirit of the Messiah, who will ultimately redeem the Jewish people from exile. {See the Midrash for numerous verses that support these correlations.}/  This Midrash shows that God, in addition to creating the laws of nature, made the exiles of the Jewish people an integral part of Creation. This idea is very difficult to understand. Why would God decree the exiles before creating the world? At the outset of Creation, there weren\'t even any Jews! Why would God punish the Jewish people before they did anything wrong - and even before He created them? For although God knows from the beginning what the outcome will be in any given situation, He still relates to us on our own terms./  * * */ FOUR EXILES/  We could suggest that the purpose of exile is not to punish us for misbehavior. Rather, the purpose of exile is to remind us that this world is a transient, temporary place. The many upheavals and expulsions throughout Jewish history have forcibly prevented us from ever feeling a sense of permanence./  According to the commentator Nachal Kadumim, this idea is hinted to in the first verse of Parshat Masei, Eleh Masei B\'nei Yisrael - "These are the journeys of the Jewish people" {Numbers 33:1}. The initials of these four Hebrew words stand for the four exiles that the Jewish people have experienced throughout the ages: Edom {Rome}, Madai {Persia-Medea}, Bavel {Babylon}, and Yavan {Syria-Greece}. The exiles are hinted to in this parsha because they convey the same message as the 42 places that the Jews encamped in the desert. Both teach us about the transience and impermanence of the physical world./  Let\'s give some examples of this idea. Imagine taking an elevator to the top of the Empire State Building. Would it ever occur to you to vacuum the carpet or polish the mirrors in the elevator? You\'d never bother, because you know you\'re going to get off any minute. This world is like an elevator {and we hope we\'re all going to get off at the top floor}! What is the use of getting overly involved in material pleasures? As our Sages say, "This world is like a lobby compared to the World to Come. Prepare yourself in the lobby so you will be able to enter the banquet hall!" {Avot 4:21}/  A related story is told about a man who was traveling across Europe about a hundred years ago. When he reached Poland, he decided to visit the town of Radin, where the great sage the Chafetz Chaim lived. He took his luggage from the train station and went straight to the Chafetz Chaim\'s house, where he was graciously ushered in. Once inside, the traveler couldn\'t believe his eyes: the home of this great rabbi was practically bare! No pictures hung on the walls, and overturned milk crates sufficed for a table and chairs. Incredulous, the traveler asked him, "Where is your furniture?"/  The Chafetz Chaim replied, "Where\'s yours?" The traveler was surprised by this strange question. "Me?" he asked. "I\'m just passing through!" "So am I," responded the Chafetz Chaim. "I am also just passing through."/  * * *// SHOPPING SPREE/  One more example should make the point abundantly clear. Imagine that you\'ve won the grand prize on a game show: a shopping spree at Macy\'s. For 15 minutes, you will have the entire store to yourself, during which time whatever merchandise you collect will be yours for the rest of your life. Try to picture what you would look like during those 15 minutes./  Now, imagine how you would react if, in the course of your frenzied shopping, a friend were to tap you on the shoulder and say, "I\'d love to chat with you, just for two minutes. Can we go get a cup of coffee?" Most likely, you wouldn\'t even take the time to respond - or perhaps you\'d just shout, "No time - I\'ll explain later," as you dashed off to the next department./  This imaginary shopping spree is comparable to our experience in this world. We each have an individual expiration date, but until that date arrives, we are in a candy store of Torah and mitzvot, and whatever we collect is ours for eternity. If we truly lived with this awareness, we would have to be reminded to eat, drink and sleep. Our physical considerations would pale in comparison to the importance of stashing away goods for eternity, and we would be constantly on the lookout for opportunities to accumulate more spiritual "merchandise." I have yet to hear anyone on their deathbed say, "If only I\'d spent a few more hours at the office..."/  May we be blessed, as we move from place to place on our journeys through life, to focus on what is truly important and not get distracted by fleeting temptations. In this merit, may God soon redeem us from our exile and afford us the opportunity to be involved in purposeful, meaningful, spiritual endeavors forever.',

He repeats the words he spoke to the people at that time: "The Lord your God, has given {"natan"} the land to you. Go up and inherit it" {Deut. 1:21}./\r\n\r\nThis verse presents a few technical difficulties. First, why does Moses say that God has already given the land to the Jewish people? The Jews have not yet entered Israel, and thus have not officially taken possession of it. Why, then, is the verb "to give" in the past tense {"natan"}? Furthermore, why does Moses say, "Go up and inherit [the land]" if he knows that the Jews will have to wage war before inheriting it? It seems that Moses should have said, "Go up and wage war"!/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest a way of understanding the upcoming war based on the words Moses spoke to the nation immediately before the Splitting of the Sea: "God will wage war for you" {Exodus 14:14}. When God promises to wage war for the Jewish people, there is no doubt as to the outcome. Therefore, even though the people are now facing an imminent battle, it is a battle that God has commanded them to fight, so it is already considered a victory./\r\n\r\nThis explains Moses\'s statement, "God... has given the land to you." The land is essentially already in the possession of the Jewish people, even though they have yet to go to war against the Canaanite nations. This also explains why Moses says, "Go up and inherit [the land]." If the war is as good as won, the Jews have only to inherit the land that God has promised them. Perhaps this is why Moses concludes the verse by saying, "Do not be afraid." The outcome of the battle is guaranteed; there is nothing to be nervous about./\r\n\r\nA support to this interpretation appears later in the parsha, when Moses recalls the battle the Jewish people waged against Sichon, the Amorite king {Deut. 2:31-34}. First, God told Moses, "Go and inherit [Sichon\'s] land" {Deut. 2:31}. Then Sichon\'s army attacked the Jewish forces {Deut. 2:32}, after which God gave the Jews the victory {2:33}. The order of these verses illustrates our point. The Jewish people began to possess Sichon\'s territory even before Sichon attacked! When God does battle for us, victory is assured from the outset./\r\n\r\n                                                   * * *///\r\n                                               HOPE OF ISRAEL//\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war against Sichon, the Jewish people utterly destroyed all of Sichon\'s cities, along with the men, women and children {Deut. 2:34}. The word used for "men" in this verse is "m\'tim," a very unusual term. Why does Moses use this word rather than the more common term "anashim"?/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that the word "m\'tim" be read as "maitim," meaning "dead people." In other words, when the Jewish forces captured Sichon\'s cities, the inhabitants were already considered "dead." This hint in the text emphasizes that God\'s promise guarantees the ultimate outcome./\r\n\r\nMaimonides explains at length that this is the Jewish perspective on every war we fight: "When the Jewish people enter into war, we rely on the Hope of Israel and its Savior [God], the One who redeems us from distressing times, and we know that we are waging war for the unification of God\'s Name. Place your soul in His hand and do not be afraid or panic... Anyone who wages war with all his heart and without fear, with the sole intention of sanctifying God\'s Name, will have no harm come to him and no evil will befall him..." {Hilchot Melachim, 7:15}./\r\n\r\nThe Book of Deuteronomy is also called "Mishneh Torah," implying a repetition of previous events. Similarly, Jewish history repeats itself. We don\'t know how current events in the Land of Israel will continue to unfold, but we know that, throughout the ages, Jews have put our trust in God that we will be victorious./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to witness the peace that comes from loving and respecting every human being, living in harmony, and serving God together.',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha is always read on the Shabbat following Tisha B\'Av. This Shabbat is known as "Shabbat Nachamu" {Shabbat of Consolation}, based on the opening words of the Haftorah: "Nachamu, nachamu, ami - Be consoled, my nation {Isaiah 40:1}. Shabbat Nachamu is intended to console us after the destruction of our Temple, since our Sages teach that if the Temple is not rebuilt in a given generation, it is as if the Temple were destroyed in that generation {Jerusalem Talmud, Yoma 1:1}./\r\n\r\nSince Parshat Va\'etchanan always coincides with Shabbat Nachamu, it seems logical that some type of "comfort" is found within the parsha itself. What comforting words does it share with us?\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s parsha, God tells the Jewish people {Deut. 4:20}, "I have taken you out of an iron furnace" {kur ha-barzel}. The expression "kur ha-barzel" refers to the Egyptian exile. We might wonder why the Torah describes Egypt with this particular phrase, when similar words could express the same idea. For example, a prophesy in the Book of Malachi {13:19} states, "Behold a day is coming, burning like an oven." It seems that the word "oven" would be an equally fitting description of Egypt. So why does this week\'s parsha specifically use the imagery of an iron furnace?/\r\n\r\nWe can shed light on this issue by examining Rashi\'s commentary on our verse. Rashi defines the word "kur" {furnace} as "a vessel within which gold is purified." We could suggest that Rashi is not merely translating the word "kur," but is also explaining why we refer to the Egyptian exile as a "kur" {furnace} and not a "tanur" {oven}. An oven is used for the everyday cooking and preparation of food. A furnace, on the other hand, has the specific function of refining gold. We can learn from here that God sent us into the Egyptian exile because He considers the Jewish people to be as precious as gold. No one bothers to refine ordinary rocks, because the result is worthless; however, people will expend great effort to refine gold, because we know that the outcome is valuable./\r\n\r\nSo too, God sent the Jewish people into the hottest of furnaces because He knew how valuable we would be when we emerged. God knew that the Jewish people would be molded by the process of exile and that, through that process, we could achieve extraordinary levels. Everyone knows that through adversity, greatness emerges./\r\n\r\nThis is how this week\'s parsha comforts us after the desolation of Tisha B\'Av. As a nation, we have certainly gone through many forms of "kur ha-barzel" during the two millennia since the destruction of the Holy Temple. Yet our experience in this "kur" is the surest indication that we are as precious as gold in God\'s eyes. Even as we yearn for redemption, we must realize that God will do whatever it takes to refine us, so that we can become as pure and as elevated as possible./\r\n\r\nMay we each recognize our intrinsic self-worth and utilize every golden opportunity to become all that we can be. In this way, may we merit the re-building of our Holy Temple in Jerusalem.',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha contains the verse, "...Not by bread alone does man live; rather, on all that comes from the mouth of God does man live" {Deut. 8:3}. We will return to this verse shortly, after we see a few other Torah sources about eating./\r\n\r\nIn Parshat Beshalach, Moses speaks to the Jewish people regarding the manna, saying, "Eat it today, for today is Shabbat; today you will not find it in the field" {Exodus 16:25}. The manna was the Jewish people\'s primary sustenance during their 40 years in the wilderness. Based on the three-fold repetition of the word "today" in this verse, the Talmud {Shabbat 117b} derives that we must eat three meals on Shabbat./\r\n\r\nWhen the day before Passover is Shabbat, bread may not be eaten for the third Shabbat meal. The Remah {Orach Chaim 444:1} states that, according to the Ashkenazi custom, egg matzah may not be eaten either. Instead, in this situation, fruit, meat and fish make up for the lack of bread or matzah. Furthermore, the Magen Avraham notes that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai used to spend the third Shabbat meal studying Torah, and this satisfied his obligation./\r\n\r\nWhere do we see that studying Torah can be an adequate substitute for eating a meal? The verse mentioned earlier from this week\'s parsha {"...Not by bread alone does man live; rather, on all that comes from the mouth of God does man live"} may explain this. The mitzvah of a Shabbat meal is not through eating "bread alone." We greatly enhance the meal by learning Torah - the Divine wisdom "that comes from the mouth of God."\r\n\r\nWe can suggest that this idea specifically refers to the third Shabbat meal. In the verse about the manna mentioned above, the third mention of the word "today" corresponds to the third meal: "Today you will not find [the manna] in the field." We can infer from here that we do not always find the nourishment for the third meal in the produce of the field. Rather, we can be nourished as well by using our mouths to speak words of Torah, as the verse says, "The matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it" {Deut. 30:14}./\r\n\r\nAmong certain circles, the third Shabbat meal tends to be neglected. This is a troubling oversight, since all three meals are an integral part of the mitzvah of Shabbat and are obligatory according to Jewish law. The Talmud {Shabbat 118a} teaches that our care in eating all three Shabbat meals will protect us from three calamities that precede the messianic era: the war of Gog and Magog {Armageddon}; the "birth pangs of Messiah" {severe disagreements among Torah scholars [Rashi]}; and the judgment of Gehenom. Each meal seemingly protects us from one of these three punishments./\r\n\r\n                                                 * * *////\r\n                                             THIRD MEAL////\r\n\r\nThe third Shabbat meal is traditionally referred to as Shalosh Seudos {literally, "three meals"}, or more accurately, Seudah Shlishit {"third meal"}. The siddur Yesodei Yeshurun, however, explains that Shalosh Seudos is actually a truer description of the meal. Eating the first two Shabbat meals is a mitzvah - but we are hungry anyway. It can therefore be difficult to tell whether we are eating these meals for God or just to satisfy our own hunger. Only once we reach the third meal {especially in the winter, when we sit down at the table again just an hour after finishing lunch} can we discern our true motivations for eating. When we push ourselves to eat the third meal, despite our lack of hunger, it is clear that we are eating only in order to fulfill a mitzvah. Our pure intentions for this meal are then retroactively applied to the first and second meals as well. The reward for all three meals is contained in the third - hence its traditional designation as Shalosh Seudos {"three meals"}./\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the weekday prayers, each of the three Amidah prayers on Shabbat is different. The Friday night Amidah mentions the creation of heaven and earth; the liturgy on Shabbat morning discusses Moses\'s bringing the Torah down from Mount Sinai; and the Amidah on Shabbat afternoon describes the messianic era, when God\'s unity will be universally recognized./\r\n\r\nThe commentator Ohr Gedaliyahu explains that each Shabbat meal corresponds to one of these monumental historical events. Thus, as we gather to eat the three delicious Shabbat meals, we also have the opportunity to digest their significance. On Friday night, we focus on strengthening our belief that God created the world. On Shabbat day, we celebrate receiving the Torah. And at the third meal, we tap into an energy of purity and sanctity that will characterize the messianic era. Our awareness of the potential of these times can help us make the most of every Shabbat./\r\n\r\nMay we be blessed with the highest of Sabbaths - not just this week, but also when we eventually reach the messianic era, described as "a day that is entirely Shabbat." Through the mitzvah of strengthening ourselves in Shabbat, its meals, and what they represent, may we be spared the difficulty and upheaval of the End of Days, and soon merit to live in a world where every day will have the sanctity of Shabbat.',

    vort: 'In the opening verse of this week\'s parsha, Moses speaks to the Jewish people and says, "See {re\'eh}, I have set before you today a blessing and a curse" {Deut. 11:26}. The word "re\'eh" seems out of place here. Moses is not showing anything to the people; he is merely informing them about the consequences of their actions! Why does the Torah present this information in terms of "seeing," when it would have made more sense to use the idea of "hearing"?/\r\n\r\nLater in the parsha, the verse instructs us "to do what is good and upright in the eyes of God" {Deut. 12:28}. Rashi {quoting the Midrash Sifri} divides this verse into two parts: the word "good" {tov} refers to doing good in the eyes of God, whereas the word "upright" {yashar} refers to acting righteously in the eyes of other people. This is a very puzzling comment. Since the verse itself links both of these qualities {"good" and "upright"} to God, how can the Midrash claim that the word "upright" refers to other people? This seems contrary to the literal meaning of the text!/\r\n\r\nA passage in the Talmud {Brachot 28b} will help us resolve both difficulties://\r\n\r\nThe students of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai came to visit him when he was on his deathbed. They gathered around their teacher and requested a blessing. Rabbi Yochanan replied, "May it be God\'s will that your fear of Heaven be as great as your fear of people." This unusual blessing surprised the students: "Is that all?" they exclaimed. It would seem that a person\'s fear of God should be even greater than his fear of people! Rabbi Yochanan responded: "You should know that when a person commits a crime, his first thought is always, \'Did anybody see me?\'"/\r\n\r\nThis Talmudic passage provides an insight into the Midrash\'s division of the verse in Parshat Re\'eh. The Torah counsels, "Do what is good and upright in the eyes of God." But how are we to know what is "good" in God\'s eyes? The seemingly superfluous word "upright" is included in the verse to teach us the following lesson. We do what is good in the eyes of God by imagining what our conduct would be if we were in the presence of important people. Acting righteously, with other people in mind, is a prerequisite to pleasing to the Divine. This interpretation does not contradict the literal meaning of the verse; rather, it teaches us an approach we must take in our daily lives to help ensure that we are doing what is "good in God\'s eyes."/\r\n\r\n                                             * * *////\r\n                                         VIVID IMAGE//\r\n\r\nNow we can understand the use of the word "re\'eh" in terms of this idea. The Talmud teaches, "Who is wise? One who sees the future" {Tamid 32a}. It is interesting that the Talmud does not attribute wisdom to one who knows the future. Instead, the word "see" is used. This teaches us an important lesson. A person who knows what will happen may not change his behavior - but a person who vividly sees, with his mind\'s eye, the potential outcome of his actions, may choose to act differently./\r\n\r\n{We all know that our time on earth is finite, yet this knowledge of our own mortality rarely spurs us to make positive changes in our lives. However, if we were to see, in our imagination, the actual moment of our death, that frightening vision of stretchers and paramedics would make us aware of our true priorities far more powerfully than mere knowledge!}/\r\n\r\nThis is why Moses uses the word "re\'eh" in addressing the Jewish people. Moses does not want the people simply to listen to his words - he wants them to vividly imagine the results of obeying or disobeying them./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed with a dynamic imagination that will lead us to an awareness of God\'s Presence. May we use our vision to truly see the ramifications of our action, speech and thought so that we can live our lives according to what is good and upright in God\'s eyes.',

    vort: 'The beginning of Parshat Shoftim cautions the judges of the Jewish people, "Do not take a bribe {shochad}" {Deut. 16:19}. The Talmud {Ketuvot 105b} asks, "What is shochad? It means SHE\'HU CHAD {that he is alone}."/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Gan Raveh explains this cryptic remark in light of another Talmudic passage {Shabbat 10a} that states, "Any judge who issues a true verdict is considered to be a partner with God in Creation." In other words, a judge who accepts a bribe cannot issue a true verdict, since the bribe will have swayed his perception of truth. Since his ruling will not be just, he can no longer be called God\'s partner in Creation. Therefore, the bribe {shochad} has led him to a state where he is alone {she\'hu chad}./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud {Ketuvot 105a} wonders what new idea we learn from the verse, "Do not take a bribe." If the phrase is trying to teach us not to acquit the guilty and accuse the innocent, this idea is stated explicitly elsewhere, "You shall not pervert judgment" {Deut. 16:19}. Rather, the Talmud explains that a judge must not take a bribe even if it is in order to acquit the innocent and accuse the guilty. Accepting a bribe is wrong even if the verdict issued is ultimately correct!/\r\n\r\nThis raises a problem. Earlier, it seemed that shochad led to the corruption of justice, which distanced the dishonest judge from God. Now it seems that shochad applies even if the judge issues a true verdict. How, then, can we say that he is considered to be chad {alone}? Ultimately, he did what was right!/\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this difficulty, we must return to the Talmudic statement we mentioned initially: "Any judge who issues a true verdict {emet l\'amito} is considered to be a partner with God in Creation." The commentator Divrei Chanoch wonders why the double expression emet l\'amito {literally, "truthful truth"} is used here, when the single word emet {truth} would seem to suffice. Once absolute truth has been reached, what could possibly make it truer?/\r\n\r\n                                             * * *//////\r\n                                       TRUTHFUL TRUTH///\r\n\r\nThe Divrei Chanoch explains, based on the Beit Yosef {Choshen Mishpat 1:2}, that even if the final ruling is true, a judge who accepts a bribe will still favor one party more than the other. This is a corruption, since the judge loves the party that gave him the bribe and hates the party that didn\'t. Although the ruling itself may be emet, the judge\'s emotions have been altered, so the verdict cannot be emet l\'amito. "Truthful truth" refers to the internal world as well, not merely an externally correct judgment./\r\n\r\nThe Divrei Chanoch therefore explains why a judge who accepts a bribe, yet issues a true verdict, is nevertheless considered to be "alone." In order to be a partner with God in Creation, a judge must be truthful through and through. Actions alone are insufficient; his emotions must also reflect his utter commitment to justice. We can learn from here that it is not enough just to act properly. We are expected to feel the right way, as well - to align our emotions with the will of God./\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentator Torat Avot, there are two levels of truth. The first level is intellectual, based on knowledge and reasoning. The second, higher level is emotional, drawn from the wisdom of the heart. This does not in any way dismiss the value of intellectual knowledge. However, it is crucial for the Torah learning that we acquire intellectually, to permeate our hearts emotionally. Torah study often changes the way we think - but we must be sure that it also changes the way we feel./\r\n\r\nMay we all merit to reach inward and live a truly truthful life, by allowing Torah to penetrate our hearts and change our feelings. In this way, may we live up to the high standards of behavior that have been set for us, so that God will judge us favorably!',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha discusses the mitzvah of Shiluach HaKen - sending away the mother bird. The Torah states {Deut. 22:7} that on chancing upon a bird\'s nest on the way, "you should send the mother bird away and take the young for yourself - in order that it will be good for you and that you will have a long life." This guarantee of longevity is found elsewhere in the Torah concerning another mitzvah, that of honoring one\'s father and mother {Exodus 20:12}. Why do these specific commandments share a common reward?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Talmud {Brachot 33b} instructs us to silence a person who, in his prayers, requests, "Just as Your mercy, God, has reached the bird\'s nest, so may it reach us as well," as this is considered an improper way to pray. The Talmud, on the same page, asks why this is so. According to one opinion, the reason is that he is wrongly referring to God\'s commandments as merciful, when in fact they are simply decrees. Why is this mitzvah regarded as merely a decree from God, as opposed to a merciful instruction from God? Is it not a fact that we are being sensitive by sending the mother bird away prior to taking her young?/\r\n\r\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that a person\'s completeness in serving God is established only when he masters two diametrically opposed character traits, for instance the antithetical attributes of compassion and harshness. If a person possesses only one of the traits, for example in this case, compassion, it does not necessarily determine his righteousness - because the individual may simply be a naturally kind person and need not have worked on managing the emotion and directing it appropriately. If, however, he possesses both opposing traits and displays control in utilizing these conflicting emotions correctly, it proves that he has worked on managing his emotions, and for this he is considered a righteous person./\r\n\r\nThere are two mitzvot that symbolically represent these opposing traits: {1} honoring one\'s parents and {2} sending away the mother bird. The former mitzvah characterizes the quality of compassion: Tending to one\'s parents, particularly as they become older and require more help, demands much compassion and concern from the caregiver. The latter mitzvah of Shiluach HaKen represents the attribute of harshness, as sending away the mother bird will cause her much distress as she is forcibly parted from her young./\r\n\r\n{Maimonides supports the idea that this mitzvah is indeed not a merciful one and remarks that if the aim of the mitzvah was for the sake of being compassionate and merciful to the mother bird, God would have forbidden us to slaughter birds altogether!}/\r\n\r\n                                                * * *//\r\n                                          IDENTICAL REWARD////\r\n\r\nBased on this insight, we can understand why the mitzvot of sending the bird and honoring parents share the identical reward of longevity. The Vilna Gaon explains that longevity symbolically represents completion, as a long life is often associated with a full and complete life. Thus through these mitzvot a person can reach completeness as he learns to control and use these opposing emotions accordingly. A reward of longevity {which symbolically represents completeness} is therefore highly fitting and appropriate!/\r\n\r\nWe could suggest that, according to the Vilna Gaon, performance of only one of these commandments is insufficient to deserve the promised reward. Only by doing both does a person become "complete," as he has demonstrated mastery over contradictory emotions in order to serve God with all parts of his being, and therefore merits the reward of long life./\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of two specific verses in Psalms highlights this further. Psalms 149:7 speaks of taking revenge on nations committed to our annihilation, and just two verses later it talks of God\'s "splendor to all His pious ones." The Vilna Gaon explains that this Psalm teaches us that although naturally pious people are kind and compassionate, they nevertheless know to take action and act harshly when the situation and circumstances are appropriate, as dictated by God and His Torah./\r\n\r\nIt is now obvious why the Talmud considers it improper if a person calls on God to show him mercy the way God displays mercy to the mother bird: A prayer of this nature is suggesting that this mitzvah represents a compassionate and merciful act when, in fact it is exactly the opposite! Shiluach HaKen is a harsh, even cruel, act and God instructs us in this mitzvah in order to teach us a lesson that our actions should all be for the sake of Heaven and not just because we are compelled by our instincts. Compassion and harshness have their place in the service of God and we are expected to work on, and use, both these emotions appropriately./\r\n\r\n                                                * * */////////\r\n                                           ABRAHAM\'S DEEDS/////\r\n\r\nBased on all this, the Vilna Gaon continues, we are able to understand a verse in Genesis 22:12 which states that at the binding of Isaac {the Akeida}, the angels said to Abraham that they "now know he has the fear of God." Albeit that the Akeida was the hardest test, yet why only at this stage did the angels "realize" that Abraham is a righteous person? Surely this was evident from the hospitality and kindness that he demonstrated earlier!/\r\n\r\nThe Vilna Gaon points out that although Abraham did perform righteous deeds, as far as the angels were concerned, his actions may have stemmed from a natural instinct to do kindness. At the final test of the Akeida, however, when Abraham was commanded to slaughter his youngest, most beloved son {a truly harsh and cruel act that he would naturally never have dreamed of doing}, he set out to act with all his mind, heart and soul, because God commanded him. It is this mastering and channeling of his emotions, for the sake of God, that confirmed to the angels how righteous and God-fearing Abraham really was./\r\n\r\nMay we all be blessed to master the art of balance, demonstrating compassion whenever possible, and harshness whenever necessary. May we merit living a long and productive life, deserving of God\'s protection as a mother bird protects her young.',

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha discusses the mitzvah of "first fruits." A Jew who owns land in Israel and grows produce on it - specifically, the seven species for which the Land of Israel is praised - must gather the first of his crop in a basket and take it to the Temple, where a special ceremony takes place {see Deut. 26:2}. This parsha is always read prior to the beginning of Slichot prayers for forgiveness preceding Rosh Hashana. What is the message of this parsha, and how does it help us prepare for Slichot?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash {Tanchuma 1} states that Moses saw prophetically that the Temple would be destroyed in the future, and that the mitzvah of the first fruits would no longer be able to be fulfilled. In response, Moses instituted three daily prayers to replace this service. The Midrash\'s statement is striking, since the Talmud {Brachot 26b} teaches that our three daily prayers were instituted by the Patriarchs. How can we understand this contradiction? Was it Moses or the Patriarchs who established our current system of prayer?/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Torah teaches that a specific statement must be recited by the person bringing the first fruits: "Then you shall answer and say...\'An Aramean destroyed my forefather..." {Deut. 26:5}. Rashi {citing Sotah 32b} explains that the word "you shall answer" refers to calling out in a loud voice. How is this interpretation derived? According to the Siftei Chachamim, the literal meaning of "you shall answer" is logical only if another person has previously spoken, necessitating a response. In this instance, however, no one has spoken at all. Therefore, our Sages expl/ained the phrase "you shall answer" to mean that we must say the prescribed statement in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation raises a difficulty. The Talmud {Brachot 24b} teaches that a person who raises his voice in prayer is considered to have little faith in God! Rashi explains that loud prayers imply a lack of belief that God can hear a whisper just as clearly. In practice, Jewish law follows this opinion {Orach Chaim 101:2, Mishna Brura 7}. If we are not permitted to raise our voice in prayer, how can our Sages specifically require it at the time we bring the first fruits?/\r\n\r\nThe commentator Chanukat HaTorah addresses this issue by stating that there are two categories of prayer. The first category is regular prayer, containing the three standard elements of praise, request and thanks. The second category is prayer that testifies explicitly that God hears our thoughts. There is an obvious difference between these two categories. It is forbidden to raise our voices if we are praying according to the first category, because the volume might be misconstrued as a lack of belief. However, if we pray according to the second category, and explicitly state that God hears our thoughts, then surely He can also hear our whispers! Thus, it is permitted to raise our voices, because doing so will not lead to any improper assumptions./\r\n\r\n                                              * * *//\r\n                                      TWO CATEGORIES OF PRAYER///\r\n\r\nThis helps us understand a seeming misstatement in the ceremony of the first fruits. The person bringing his produce is required to say, "An Aramean [Lavan] destroyed my forefather [Yaakov]." But historically, this is not true! If Lavan didn\'t kill Yaakov, why would the Torah command us to say that he did? Rashi explains {Deut. 26:5, based on Sifri and JT Peah 1:1} that Lavan wanted to destroy Yaakov and his entire family. Since, among the non-Jewish nations, evil thoughts have the same status as evil acts, Lavan\'s desire to kill Yaakov was considered an actual murder. Therefore, a Jew who explicitly states, "An Aramean destroyed my forefather" is effectively stating that God hears a person\'s thoughts! Therefore, the person falls under the second category of prayer, and is allowed to raise his voice./\r\n\r\nOnce we are permitted to raise our voice in prayer, it is actually preferable to do so. The Aruch HaShulchan {Orach Chaim 101:8} states that raising our voices in prayer awakens our hearts. Additionally, we can suggest that loud prayer helps free us of our inhibitions, which elevates the words we say./\r\n\r\nThe concept of two categories of prayer will resolve the problem of who instituted daily prayers as a replacement for the service of first fruits. Based on the Talmud {Eruvin 16b}, which teaches "These and those are the words of the living God," we can suggest that both Moses AND the Patriarchs established our daily prayer service. The Patriarchs instituted prayer according to the first category, in which it is forbidden to call out loudly. Moses instituted prayer according to the second category, in which we explicitly state God\'s omniscience./\r\n\r\nWe see that the Amidah, corresponding to the Patriarchs, is said silently. But when do we experience Moses\'s type of prayer? One example is the Slichot service, in which we ask God\'s forgiveness for not only our improper actions and speech, but even for inappropriate thoughts. Asking forgiveness for improper thoughts is tantamount to acknowledging that God is aware of them. Thus, it is permissible to raise our voices. Furthermore, according to some customs, Slichot are said immediately after the Amidah, thereby juxtaposing the Patriarchs {silent prayer} with Moses {heartfelt cries for forgiveness}./\r\n\r\nAt last we see how this week\'s parsha relates to Slichot. When we read about the prayer spoken over the first fruits, we prepare ourselves to call out to God. Slichot, too, are spoken out loud, in order to awaken our emotions. They belong to the second category of prayer - Moses\'s category - in which we are encouraged to raise our voices to God and arouse our hearts to higher levels of connection./\r\n\r\nMay we all raise our voices in prayer so that, through truly meaning and feeling what we say, we arouse ourselves to become closer to God. In this merit may we be completely forgiven, and deserve to hear the loud shofar blast symbolizing the building of the Third Temple, where we\'ll once again bring the first fruits.',

    vort: "The three keys to spiritual success.\nIn this /week'/s /parsha (/Deut. /30//:12), we are told that the Torah 'is not found in Heaven' (Lo BaShamayim Hee). The Talmud (Baba Metzia 59) relates a story that connects to this verse:\nThere was once a debate concerning the status of an oven's purity. It was dubbed the 'Snake Oven,' due to the amount of discussion 'coiled' around the topic, as a snake coils around its prey. Rabbi Eliezer maintained that the oven was pure, while the other Sages argued otherwise. To prove his viewpoint, Rabbi Eliezer said, 'If the law is like me, let this carob tree prove it' The tree suddenly uprooted itself and flew about the length of a football field. The Sages, unimpressed, commented that proof of Jewish law cannot be brought from a carob tree.\nRabbi Eliezer continued, 'If the law is like me, let this stream of water prove it,'' at which point the stream began to flow uphill, a truly miraculous event! Again, the Sages were unmoved and stated that Jewish law could not be verified through the water. So Rabbi Eliezer continued, 'If the law is like me, let the walls of this study hall prove it.' Suddenly, the walls began to cave in.\nAlthough the walls of the study hall caved inward out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer, they did not collapse completely, out of respect for Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages, but remained at a tilt. The Sages stated that we do not bring proof of Jewish law through the walls of a Beit Midrash. And Rabbi Yehoshua, one of the Sages, exclaimed to the walls, 'Why are you getting involved in a debate between the Sages?!\nWith the Sages still not persuaded, Rabbi Eliezer called to Heaven to prove his opinion correct. Immediately, a heavenly voice (Bat Kol) rang out, 'Why do you argue with Rabbi Eliezer? The law is like him at all times!'' To protest, Rabbi Yehoshua arose and cited the verse in this week's portion, Lo Bashamayim Hee - [Torah] is not in Heaven.' Since God gave the Torah to the Jewish people, at Mount Sinai, authority over Torah matters is here on Earth, not in Heaven!\nFurthermore, since the Torah states (Exodus 23:2) that we are to rule according to the majority, that in itself is explicit proof that in the case of the oven the law was in accordance with the consensus of Sages.\nSome time after this incident, Rabbi Nathan saw Elijah the Prophet and asked him how God had reacted at the conclusion of the 'Snake Oven' debate. He responded that God had (metaphorically) smiled and said, 'My children have been victorious over Me!'\nSeveral questions arise concerning this story: If the first sign (the uprooted carob tree) that Rabbi Eliezer revealed did not impress the Sages, why did he continue to convey more? Surely the Sages were not interested in proof from signs. And why did Rabbi Eliezer choose these specific signs? What do these items symbolize?\n* * *\n THE THREE KEYS\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that there are three keys to success in Torah:\n1. Histap'kut - Sufficiency, that is being content with one's (material) lot.n2. Anivut - Humility.\n3. Shkeida Raba - Diligence.\nThere are several sources where we learn of the importance of Histap'kut in acquiring Torah. For instance, the Talmud says (Avot 6:4) that 'the way of Torah is eating bread with salt, drinking a measured amount of water, and sleeping on the ground' - in other words, where a person could handle, if necessary, a life where physical needs reach only the most basic level.\nFurthermore, the Talmud (Brachot 17b) relates that every day a voice is heard from Mount Sinai, saying,'The whole world is sustained through the merit of My (God's) child, Chanina, who sustains himself on a measure of carob from one Shabbat to the next,' implying that Rabbi Chanina's greatness was achieved by subsisting on a bare minimum.\nThis could be a reason why Mount Sinai is also referred to as Chorev (Exodus 33:6), as it has exactly the same letters as the word Charuv - carob. The way to acquire Torah, given at Chorev, is by being able to make do with a minimal amount of material comforts.\nThe second key which the Vilna Gaon mentions - humility - is derived from the Talmud (Ta'anit 7a, citing Isaiah 55:1) which compares the Torah to water. Just as water runs from high places and comes to rest in low places, so too Torah moves away from 'high' or haughty people and resides in \"low,\" humble people. The importance of this attribute is emphasized in the Talmud (Eruvin 13b) which states that the law is always like Hillel, who was known for his humility, as opposed to Shamai, even though the latter was intellectually superior. The third key - diligence - is highlighted in the Talmud (Eruvin 21b-22a) which states that Torah is found among those who rise early and stay late in the study hall. Diligence in Torah necessitates dedicating much time and energy to it's study, and is of paramount importance for success in becoming a Torah scholar./\r\n\r\n[We could suggest that these three keys are hinted at in the three blessings that we recite prior to studying Torah (see Brachot 11b). The first blessing, La'asok BeDivrei Torah - 'to engage, or toil over the words of Torah,' corresponds to the attribute of diligence, as much time, effort and dedication is required for success in this area. The second blessing, 'VeHa'arev Na', where we ask God to make the Torah sweet for us, refers to Histap'kut, as happiness and sweetness are achieved by means of being satisfied with one's material lot. Finally, the third blessing, 'Notein HaTorah', where we mention 'the One who gives us the Torah', corresponds to the trait of humility, as we humbly recognize that we do not take the Torah from God but rather, that God chooses to whom He gives the Torah. It is therefore fitting that prior to learning Torah, we recite these blessings, to remind us of the three ways to achieve success in our studies.]\n * * *\n THE THREE PROOFS\nWe can now understand the answer to the third question posed earlier, regarding why Rabbi Eliezer used the specific items of a carob tree, water and study hall as signs to verify his halachic decision, and why Rabbi Eliezer continued to bring more signs even after the Sages were unmoved by the first sign.\nThrough the carob tree (symbolizing Histap'kut), Rabbi Eliezer hinted to the Sages that he possessed the attribute of being content with his physical lot. He assumed that his acquisition of this key to Torah would serve as confirmation of his accurate understanding of the law. The Sages, however, were unimpressed, so Rabbi Eliezer thought to show his possession of the majority of keys to Torah. He therefore proceeded to the next sign, using water, which symbolizes humility, as a proof that he had also attained the second key to Torah.\nAgain, however, the Sages were not swayed, so Rabbi Eliezer realized that he must show that he has acquired all the keys to Torah. He therefore brought the third sign, where the walls of the study hall began to collapse, hinting that he possessed the attribute of diligence. Surely, after proving that he had acquired all three keys, the Sages would admit that his understanding of Halacha must be correct?\nFinally, once Rabbi Eliezer realized that even all three keys would not impress the Sages, he called upon Heaven to verify his conclusion. A heavenly voice was heard, validating all of Rabbi Eliezer's halachic rulings, but Rabbi Yehoshua, still undeterred, promptly arose and exclaimed, Lo BaShamyim Hee - 'Torah is not in Heaven!\nA Midrash helps us understand why even the voice from Heaven did not sway the Sages to accept Rabbi Eliezer's decision. The Midrash (Bereishit Raba 8:5) relates that when God wanted to create Man, some angels were in agreement, while others opposed the idea. This scenario is hinted to in Psalms 80:11 which says, 'Kindness and Truth have met.' The Midrash states that Chesed (kindness) went to God, as it were, and told Him to create Man because he will perform many good deeds. However, Emet (truth) claimed that Man will be filled with falsehood and should therefore not be created. God took Truth, says the Midrash, and cast it to Earth. (As it says in Daniel 8:12, 'And it shall cast Truth to the ground,' and in Psalms 85:12, 'Truth grows from the ground.')\nWhy did Truth claim to God that Man was unworthy of being created? The Vilna Gaon suggests it was due to the fact that Man, with his limited intellectual capacity, would not have the ability to fully recognize Truth. Thus to circumvent this claim, God cast Truth to the Earth, enabling Man to access it - and thus worthy of being created!\nThe Vilna Gaon explains that Torah is the truth which God cast to Earth (Torat Emet - see Malachi 2:6). This is why Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages, even after hearing the heavenly voice thundering that Rabbi Eliezer's conclusion is correct, were undeterred. They recognized that Truth, the will of God, lies not in Heaven, but here on Earth, with the word of God that was already handed to us at Mount Sinai, in the Torah.\nWe could suggest that is why God smiled and said, 'My children have been victorious.' In effect the oven incident was a test from God to see whether the Sages would concede under pressure from the signs (particularly the heavenly voice) and accept the validity of Rabbi Eliezer's ruling, or whether they would stand firm with the Truth of Torah. The Sages succeeded, and thus guaranteed the eternity of the Torah in the world, because the only way that Torah can be perpetuated down the generations is through the teachings of our Sages who hold the keys to the truth. (The words 'victory' and 'eternity' share the same root, netzach.)\nThe real bearers of Truth are those connected to Torah. Our tzaddikim individuals with fully refined characters and giants in Torah wisdom, hold the keys to the will of God. We must not doubt nor fear the decisions and advice of our Sages, but follow them wholeheartedly, as we are told in Deut. 17:11, because we recognize that it is they who know the truth.r\nAnd with this, may we all merit the keys to spiritual success!",

    vort: 'This week\'s parsha is always read close to Rosh Hashana, which indicates it has a connection to this great and awesome day. How does this week\'s portion help prepare us for the Day of Judgment?/\r\n\r\nI find that many of us are filled with trepidation as Rosh Hashana approaches. We know that we are about to enter the courtroom where our fates for the year - regarding health, finances, spouse, children, etc. - will be written and sealed. The seriousness of this time of year often causes us to scramble for "tricks" that will guarantee a sweet future for ourselves. I would like to share one fundamental idea that, although simple to put into practice, can have far-reaching results in our lives./\r\n\r\nIn order to positively impact our future, it is crucial that we learn how to be "defense attorneys" on behalf of the Jewish people. The Talmud (Sotah 8b) teaches that the way we measure other people is the way that we are measured by God. In other words, if we refrain from criticism and accusations, and instead are careful to say only positive things about our fellow Jews, God will reciprocate in kind. We must learn to emphasize the good we see in Jewish individuals, communities, and in the nation as a whole, if we are to create a positive impression in the upper worlds./\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate this idea on Rosh Hashana by blowing the shofar. The holiness and purity of the shofar blast causes many of us to feel chills up and down our spines, or even to be moved to tears. This reaction is no coincidence. Our mystical tradition teaches that the sound of a shofar is, in fact, the collective voice of the Jewish people. No matter who we are or what we do, quivering deep inside of us is a pure and holy voice that is calling out to God and wanting to fulfill His will./\r\n\r\nKeeping this thought in mind can add a new dimension to the way we listen to the shofar this year. The sound of the shofar testifies that every Jew is a beautiful person, who, deep down, wants to do the right thing. If we can cultivate this awareness, and lovingly excuse other people\'s mistakes, then we will succeed in defending the Jewish people - whereupon God will reciprocate by accentuating our own positive behavior and finding justifications for our own mistakes./\r\n\r\nOne hint to this idea can be seen in Deut. 29:17, "Lest there be among you a root that produces haughtiness and wormwood" (Pen yaish bachem shoresh poreh rosh v\'la\'anah). The Mayana Shel Torah points out that the initial letters of the last four words of this verse (SH-oresh, P-oreh, R-osh, V-la\'anah) form an acronym of the word SHOFAR. In his view, this teaches us that the shofar blasts can remove any bad "root" that may be found within us./\r\n\r\nWe could also suggest an additional understanding of this verse. Even if our actions, speech, and thoughts have been negative, we still contain within us the holy and pure sound of a shofar that is calling out to be close to God./\r\n\r\nIt is important to defend the Jewish people by speaking positively about others instead of articulating their shortcomings. Involving ourselves in this exercise is the ideal preparation for Rosh Hashana, since the primary mitzvah of the day is the blowing of the shofar, which reminds us of our inner purity and holiness. May we be blessed this year to see only the positive and to recognize the shofar\'s voice hidden inside each and every one of us, so that we all receive an overabundant downpour of happiness, health, and wealth.',

    vort: 'The Shabbat between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur is called is Shabbat Shuva (the Shabbat of Return)./\r\n\r\nThe Amidah of the High Holiday prayers contains the prayer, "You chose us from all the nations, You loved us and You desired us." Although this prayer is phrased in the past tense, it also implies that God continually chooses, loves, and desires the Jewish people./\r\n\r\nThe commentator Dover Shalom explains that the three expressions used in this prayer correspond to three levels of love. The lowest level is when we are loved because we are better than the other available options. Although we may be flawed, we are superior in comparison to the alternatives. The middle level is when we are loved because we are inherently good. The highest level is when we are loved unconditionally, for no reason at all. If there was a reason, it would be the reason that was loved, not us!/\r\n\r\nThe phrase "You chose us from all the nations" corresponds to the lowest level of love, when we are loved only in comparison to the alternative options. The Talmud (Avodah Zara 2b, on Deut. 33:2) teaches that God initially offered the Torah to the nations of the world, all of whom refused to accept it. Only the Jewish people eagerly responded, "We will do and we will hear!" (Exodus 24:7). Based on this positive response, God gave the Torah to us./\r\n\r\n[The Jews could therefore more accurately be called the Choosing People, not the Chosen People. We chose God first, and He reciprocated. From the Jewish perspective, God will choose anyone who chooses Him.]/\r\n\r\nThe phrase "You loved us" corresponds to the second level of love, when we are loved due to our intrinsic goodness. Not only are we preferable over other options; we are actually inherently lovable! Finally, the phrase "You desired us" corresponds to the highest level of love: inexplicable, absolute love that does not depend on reason./\r\n\r\nThe love between God and the Jewish people is compared to the love between a husband and a wife. The Mishnah (Kiddushin 1:1) teaches that there are three ways for a marriage to legally take effect: through a monetary transaction, a contract, or consummation. God married the Jewish people in all three ways. The Egyptian riches that washed ashore after the Jewish people crossed the Sea represent a monetary transaction (see Sefer HaMakneh on Kiddushin, Pischa Zeira). The Jewish people received our marriage contract at Mount Sinai, when God gave us the Torah; and our marriage was consummated during the time that the Jewish people lived within the privacy of the Divine Clouds of Glory./\r\n\r\n                                                  * * */\r\n                                           THREE LEVELS OF LOVE//\r\n\r\nWe can understand these three conditions for marriage as representing the three levels of love. God does not fulfill just one or two of these conditions; He sends us an outpouring of love, showing that He wants to connect with us in every possible way. The mitzvah of tefillin, in which a strap is wrapped three times around the middle finger, also expresses this idea. With each loop, we recite a verse beginning with the words, "I am betrothed to you" (Hoshea 2:21-22). The three loops that are formed look like three rings, representing marriage and the three levels of love. Every day, on an ongoing basis, God chooses us, loves us and desires us./\r\n\r\nThe preface to the Otzer Tefillot states that the main thrust of the High Holiday prayers is for God to reveal Himself to all nations and peoples, thereby eliminating the desecration of His name and increasing its sanctification. Perhaps our Sages chose to word the prayers this way so that we could attempt to reciprocate God\'s love and devotion to us. On Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, when our very lives are hanging in the balance, the greatest demonstration of love is our ability to rise above our personal concerns and devote ourselves solely to the revelation of God\'s glory. When God sees that we are mature enough to disregard our own needs and put His will above all else, He will do anything for us. This is the best way to secure for ourselves a sweet new year./\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our intentions must be sincere. The Talmud (Baba Kama 92a) teaches that a person who prays on behalf of another when he himself needs the same thing will be answered first. This does not mean to say that two poor people can make a plan to pray for each other so that they\'ll both get answered fast! In such a scenario, neither person is actually praying for the other; each is praying for himself, while using the other person as a device. The same is true with our intentions in the High Holiday prayers. We must not fool ourselves into thinking we are praying for the manifestation of God\'s glory, when really we just want to guarantee a good year for ourselves. Our ability to transcend our personal concerns is precisely what allows God to fulfill them./\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Day of Judgment, may we learn how to take ourselves out of the center and focus on God, and through this ultimate demonstration of love, may we be inscribed in the Book of Good Life.',

    vort: "Five ways that the Torah brings us joy./\r\n\r\nJon Krakauer describes reaching the top of Mount Everest in his book, Into Thin Air:/\r\n\r\n“Straddling the top of the world, one foot in China and the other in Nepal, I cleared the ice from my oxygen mask, hunched a shoulder against the wind and stared absently down at the vastness of Tibet. I understood on some dim, detached level that the sweep of earth beneath my feet was a spectacular sight. I’d been fantasizing about this moment, and the release of emotion that would accompany it, for many months. But now that I was finally here, actually standing on the summit of Mount Everest, I just couldn’t summon the energy to care.” (Jon Krakauer, Into Thin Air, p.5)/\r\n\r\nI was so startled by his description I had to read the paragraph a few times. It shook me up that a person could work for years training for a climb like this, dreaming about standing on the top of that mountain, looking out at the thousands and thousands of feet that he had found a way to rise above and be too tired to care./\r\n\r\nBut this happens often in life. We imagine that once we reach our destination, we will be ecstatic. We fantasize about that moment of happiness, but it is elusive, falling so easily out of our grasps, disappointing us just at the moment when we are straddling the top of the world.\r\n\r\nHow can we find and hold onto joy in this world without it slipping out of our hands? The holiday of Simchat Torah provides an answer. As we dance with the Torah, we bask in the unique, eternal happiness that only Torah can bring into our lives. “It is a tree of life for those who grasp it” (Proverbs 3:18).\r\n\r\nHere are five ways that Torah brings us this lasting joy and life.////\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It gives us higher goals. The highest predictor of a person’s lasting happiness is a goal that transcends himself. All of our personal goals, however important they may be, are part of a greater mission that all Jews share – to bring light to the world, to honor God’s Name, to pass on our sacred traditions. The Torah gives us higher goals to strive for./\r\n\r\n2. It shows us how to be grateful. Most people understand why gratitude increases our happiness levels, but we don’t necessarily know how to feel grateful on a daily basis. The Torah shows us how to be grateful several times each day. With prayer three times a day, with blessings over food and mitzvot. It imbues within us a constant awareness that we are receiving goodness and kindness from the Source of all life from the moment we open our eyes in the morning./\r\n\r\n3. It teaches us hope. Life is hard and often unpredictable. Many of us have different challenges that make it difficult to see a way forward. But the Torah teaches us that nothing is impossible. That God never gives us circumstances that we can’t handle. That tomorrow will be brighter. That redemption is in our future. That we are not struggling in vain./\r\n\r\n4. It connects us. In a world where so many are lonely and dependent upon virtual company, the Torah pulls us each out of our isolation. It shows us how to set up communities and bring people together. It teaches us that we need each other. It helps us give even when we’re not sure how. It connects grandparents to their grandchildren. It bridges the cultural gaps that so often divide us. It gives us a common language and a shared truth. It connects us to each other./\r\n\r\n5. It gives us flow. Our happiest moments occur when we are in the “flow,” completely engaged and absorbed by an activity we are doing. We transcend our physical and emotional limitations by immersing ourselves in the energy of the moment. Torah gives us this sense of flow when we are doing a mitzvah that is challenging for us but within our grasps. We visit the sick even when hospitals make us nervous. We invite the widow from across the street to Shabbos dinner even though we aren’t in the mood for guests. We give tzedakah even though we are anxious about our finances. We choose to overcome a limitation inside of us and move forward even when we have to push ourselves to do so./\r\n\r\nBut the Torah also gives us this sense of flow through song and dance. This is the flow of Simchat Torah, celebrating the Torah that teaches us how to transcend our limits, how to be happy, how to be connected. How to sing songs that weave circles into circles that climb beyond the dancers themselves. The words that we sing bring us back to the core of who we are. The higher goals, the gratitude, the hope, the sheer joy of connecting to our Creator. For this moment He created us. For this joy He created the world. It is a happiness that won’t slip away whether we are straddling the top of the world or just beginning our climb. It is in fact right there in our arms – the gift of the Torah that He gives to us. A happiness, a joy, that dances beyond itself.",
